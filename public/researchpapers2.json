Instead of allowing or expecting women to deal with these problems individually, we should address them by challenging the patriarchal structure of the labour market\u2014for example, by securing equal pay and affordable childcare. In a recent article in Journal of Medical Ethics (JME), I argue that we should distinguish between different versions of this kind of reasoning and that all the versions discussed are implausible. In three separate comments following my article in the March 2021 issue of JME, Moen, Segers and CampoEngelstein have supported and criticised some of my results. It is impossible, in such a short reply, to discuss all of their many relevant comments in detail, but in what follows I will reply to some of their criticism. Moen presents several interesting comments; let me try to deal with what I take to be the two most important ones. The first of these deals with some of my critical comments concerning what I have called the distraction view, according to which the use of NMEF is problematic because it draws attention away from social solutions. In my article, I mention that the ethical discussion of NMEF by politicians, scholars and the public usually also attracts attention to the moral problems that women face on the labour market. However, according to Moen, such an observation is off target, as opponents of NMEF do not deny that the discussion of NMEF attracts attention to women\u2019s problems on the labour market, but they oppose the practice of NMEF. Even if Moen is right about this, which seems plausible, it is not obvious that we can separate the discussion and practice of NMEF as Moen intends. The discussion of NMEF is necessary to challenge its practice; if no politicians, scholars or the public did discuss the ethics of NMEF, we could not know how and why some people oppose NMEF. Second, Moen argues that if NMEF is a positional good, according to which the advantage of using NMEF (e.g. in competing for jobs) is mainly an advantage relative to others and should therefore not be subsidised by the state, as this would not promote overall wellbeing. I believe, however, that there are good arguments in favour of the view that having access to NMEF is mainly a nonpositional good, as the result of using NMEF might be to have a child. Having a child by means of technology can be seen as a good in itself whether or not others have access to this technology and have children because of it. I take Segers\u2019s main comments to be the following two. First, Segers claims that the authors I discuss in my article are incorrectly reduced to adherents of the argument from individualisation, which concludes that it is morally wrong for women to use NMEF. Second, that I have overlooked the multifaceted nature of these scholars. I agree with Segers\u2019s first comment, although it is easy, from the quotations by the authors under discussion, to infer the abovementioned moral conclusion. However, it would have been fairer and more in accordance with the views of the authors being discussed if the argument from individualisation had been formulated with a conclusion that did not claim that it is morally wrong for individuals to use NMEF, but with a conclusion claiming that there is a moral reason for individuals not to use NMEF. To argue that there is a moral reason against a certain practice is not to argue that this practice, all things considered, is morally wrong\u2014it depends on the weighing of all the reasons for or against the practice in question. Concerning Segers\u2019s second comment, I am not convinced it is a fair criticism. In the introduction of the article, I explicitly make it clear that there are other reasons for being sceptical about the use of NMEF\u2014 reasons that, for example, have to do with a \u2018morally problematic peer pressure\u2019 to use NMEF, with NMEF giving \u2018false hope to women\u2019 or with women being \u2018victims of a greedy fertility industry\u2019. Some of these concerns are supported by references to some of the authors that are dealt with in the paper. Although very supportive and in line with most of the reasoning in my article, CampoEngelstein has two main concerns. First, CampoEngelstein claims that we may overlook some ethical problems if, as is done in my article, we talk about women as a heteronomous group. In order to know whether NMEF is beneficial to women, we should be aware of the social hierarchies that exist between women and include, for example, empirical data showing how less privileged women experience the access and use of NMEF. I agree with this, and if I had had more space in the original article, this is definitely an aspect that should have been developed. Second, CampoEngelstein believes that it would be more correct if instead of writing \u2018NMEF is able to increase the probability of some women having a child at all\u2019, I had written that \u2019NMEF could increase the chance of having a genetically related child\u2019. The problem with the first formulation is that it may seem to reveal a problematic assumption of what it means to be a parent that is best captured in the second formulation. I agree here with CampoEngelstein that it is a problematic assumption as parenthood can be just as desired and fulfilling if you are not genetically related to your child.", "authors": ["T.

These changes span social, emotional, and cognitive domains. While some researchers have argued that a domain-general development explains some of the changes, such a position is a minority view. In the current article, we provide some evidence for the development of an age 4 domain-general enabling constraint on children\u2019s ability to reflect. In turn, the development of reflection is argued to enable the transitions that we see within and across developmental domains. The model of reflection being offered is part of a broader action-based model of cognition and mind \u2013 interactivism (Bickhard, 1973, 1978, 2009a,b). The empirical part of the article presents a new object reasoning task. This task was derived from theoretical constraints on the interactivist models of knowing and reflection. Results indicated that most children responded to the task incorrectly until age 4 which was interpreted as evidence that they lacked the ability to explicitly reason about relations between objects. Correlations between our new task and standard false-belief tasks were explored.

What this journal has elected to publish is a biased, retrospective analysis of the published results from two successful, well-controlled clinical trials. In the author\u2019s own words: \u201cWhile metaanalysis offers a standardized method of data analysis, results may be interpreted in various ways.\u201d Following this declaration, Spielmans provides his limited personal perspective on the retrospective analysis, strongly suggesting that his uninformed personal interpretation of the meta-analyses supersedes the individual trial analyses conducted using patientlevel data by the trial sponsor and corroborated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of the drug approval process. In the limitations section of Spielmans\u2019s article, there is an acknowledgment that \u201cBremelanotide (BMT) appears to offer modest benefits on the Female Sexual Function Index-Desire Domain (FSFI-D) (Rosen et al., 2000) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Desire, Arousal, Orgasm, Item 13 (FSDS-DAO #13)\u201d (Derogatis et al., 2008). Spielmans is not a treating clinician and is unaware of the validation that was conducted, at the direction of the U.S. FDA, to establish clinically meaningful cutoffs of the various patient-reported outcomes to define clinical benefit (Revicki et al., 2018). It is questionable how Spielmans can both interpret and denigrate the extent of the comprehensive benefit bremelanotide (BMT) provides for a patient. In numerous cases, Spielmans states that placebo outperformed BMT; the authors of this commentary encourage all readers to avail themselves of the published results from Kingsberg et al. (2019), where Figure 3 presents the results of BMT over placebo for eight individual patient-reported outcomes within each of the two Phase III studies. Spielmans\u2019s statement is also factually incorrect in stating, \u201cmost reported efficacy outcomes were apparently derived post-hoc\u201d; the extensive statistical analysis plan that was prepared and reviewed by the FDA defined each analysis in detail prior to database lock. The phase III BMT program involving over 1200 women was the culmination of over a decade of research, supported by over a dozen individual studies involving the compound for treating this disorder (e.g., Clayton et al., 2016). The alternative interpretation of the retrospective analyses conducted by Spielmans goes far beyond claiming that the FDA was wrong for approving this drug. For example, he lists as a \u201cproblem\u201d that not everything in the study protocol was included in our Kingsberg et al. (2019) paper. In contrast to the Journal of Sex Research that provided 20 pages for Spielmans\u2019s article, many, high-impact, scientifically rigorous journals have a page limit. He also alludes to \u201cdata peeking\u201d in his introduction and that the FDA allowed the \u201csponsor\u2019s request for satisfying sexual events (SSEs) to move from the co-primary to the key secondary outcome . . .. a year after the trials had begun.\u201d What Spielmans omitted is that the FDA published a guidance document (2016) for designing clinical trials in which SSEs were no longer required to be a primary endpoint for HSDD treatment trials. Instead, trials could now include measures reflecting the hallmark criteria of the condition: loss of (i.e., deficiency or absence of) sexual desire (i.e., FSFI-D) and distress about lack of desire (i.e., FSDS-DAO #13). The approval from the FDA to change the primary endpoint, after discussion with the FDA review division, came prior to the data lock in these well-conducted, randomized, double-blind, multicenter placebo-controlled trials, with pre-established statistical analysis plans. All sites received investigational review board (IRB) approval and were conducted according to good clinical practice, and the suggestion of any research malfeasance by Spielmans is baseless and false. A researcher with expertise in sexual medicine would likely know the rigor and oversight of these trials along with the historical context in the change of endpoints that they reflect, the evolution of this field with an improved understanding of how to evaluate this condition (HSDD), and that SSEs had long been deemed by experts as a poor surrogate of desire and instead, a downstream effect of desire (Kingsberg & Althof, 2011). The medical community welcomes the constructive review by subject experts to help improve the process leading to the development of safe and effective medications for patients with few treatment options. However, the retrospective analysis performed by Spielmans fails to acknowledge the decade of diligent research that culminated in a drug that the FDA scrutinized through the development process to a point that", "authors": ["S.

INTRODUCTION Since the early 1990s, international peace-promotion efforts have increasingly involved international \u2018peacebuilding\u2019 interventions. These have encompassed diverse activities, 1 Acknowledgements: The research was supported by an Australian Research Council Discovery Project grant DP13102273.

In the 1990s, Western governments and international organizations operated largely within a \u2018liberal peace\u2019 paradigm, assuming that stabilising \u2018fragile\u2019 and post-conflict states required rapid democratization and marketization (Paris, 2004). However, from the 2000s, as failures of implementation and outcome abounded, peacebuilding has increasingly been delivered through \u2018statebuilding\u2019. Statebuilding denotes a \u2018broad range of programs and projects designed to build or strengthen the capacity of institutions, organisation and agencies \u2013 not all of which are necessarily part of the state apparatus \u2013 to effectively perform the functions associated with modern statehood\u2019 (Hameiri, 2010: 2). Peacebuilding is thus frequently combined with statebuilding to reshape target societies, polities and economies towards more peaceful outcomes. These efforts, despite their often technocratic presentation, are inherently political, seeking to (re)allocate power and resources and shift political outcomes. Accordingly, they are frequently contested, as are their associated modes of governance. In many prominent cases, this contestation has led peacebuilding or statebuilding interventions (PSBIs) to fail to attain their governance objectives, or even to pacify target societies, prompting critical reflection among scholars and practitioners. In the 2000s, some began arguing that these failures reflected incompatibility between the liberal institutions interveners were promoting and target societies\u2019 culture, norms and institutions, with resistance to defend local customs and authority undermining PSBIs (Richmond, 2005). This generated early recommendations for interveners to respect and incorporate local \u2018paradigms\u2019 into their projects (Chopra and Hohe, 2004). Policymakers have increasingly adopted this perspective, reflected in the turn to counterinsurgency strategies in Iraq and Afghanistan, which involve cultivating alliances with tribal leaders to combat Islamist insurgents. Practitioners now prescribe modes of intervention that are more compatible with local values and institutions (Mac Ginty and Richmond, 2015). This \u2018local turn\u2019 has spurred closer scholarly attention to how interactions between international interventions and target societies shape PSBI outcomes. The core concept used here is \u2018hybridity\u2019. This essentially denotes the mixing of international/liberal and local/non-liberal agendas, ideas, institutions and authority structures. Reflecting different usages in peace studies, IR and development, the concept is used diversely, with both proscriptive and descriptive applications (Millar, 2014: 1). For many peacebuilding scholars, \u2018hybridity\u2019 is a normative project, used to critique \u2018top-down\u2019 interventions and advocate engagement with \u2018local\u2019, \u2018everyday\u2019, non-state-based identities, traditions and practices to achieve more \u2018emancipatory\u2019 outcomes (e.g. Mac Ginty and Richmond, 2015). For many statebuilding scholars, hybridity is used more descriptively, to explain the emergence of \u2018hybridised\u2019 political orders through often conflictual encounters between international interveners and local populations (e.g. Wallis, 2012). This shift towards studying the crucial nexus between international intervention and local politics and governance was essential, since this is obviously where PSBI outcomes are determined. However, we argue that this scholarship, whether peace-based or state-based, has been constrained by the \u2018hybridity\u2019 concept. \u2018Hybridity\u2019 does not adequately describe international interventions\u2019 effects on local politics, nor does it properly explain their uneven outcomes. Despite recent efforts at nuance, hybridity ultimately dichotomizes and reifies local-traditional and international-liberal ideal-typical assemblages of institutions, actors and practices. Conflicts between these binary assemblages are seen to generate \u2018hybrid\u2019 orders. This approach is descriptively inaccurate insofar as some \u2018locals\u2019 support some \u2018international\u2019 PSBI agendas, while others resist. Nor do \u2018internationals\u2019 always promote \u2018liberal\u2019 agendas while \u2018locals\u2019 favour \u2018traditional\u2019 ones. Although recognized by some hybridity scholars, these complex realities are impossible to address coherently within an inherently dichotomizing framework. Moreover, merely locating PSBI outcomes on a \u2018local\u2019\u2018international\u2019 spectrum, as hybridity scholars do, does not explain why particular modes of governance emerge or whose interests they serve. Our alternative explanatory framework reconceptualizes the interaction between intervention and \u2018local\u2019 politics as a politics of scale. Scale, in political geography, refers to hierarchized social, political and economic territorial spaces, each denoting \u2018the arena and moment, both discursively and materially, where sociospatial power relations are contested and compromises are negotiated and regulated\u2019 (Swyngedouw, 1997: 140). Scale matters in PSBIs because interveners inevitably seek to reallocate power and resources among different scales, e.g. embedding international disciplines into a centralised national state (Hameiri, 2010), or decentralising power to subnational, state-based or \u2018traditional\u2019 agencies (Hirblinger and Simons, 2015). Scales like \u2018local\u2019, \u2018subnational\u2019, \u2018national\u2019 or \u2018global\u2019 are not neutral; they involve particular configurations of actors, resources and political opportunity structures that always favour some forces and agendas over others (Gough, 2004). Thus, PSBIs are not contested simply because \u2018locals\u2019 reject \u2018international\u2019 actors\u2019 \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019 agendas, but because social groups favour different scalar arrangements in line with 2 Similar criticisms apply to the literature on \u2018friction\u2019 in international-local relations. Given space constraints, we focus only on hybridity. their interests and agendas (Smith, 2003). What emerges is not simply to be described as a local-international \u2018hybrid\u2019, but must be explained as stemming from contestation over scaled modes of governance by socio-political forces located at diverse scales, potentially in tactical, multi-scalar alliances. The remainder of this article describes and critiques the hybridity literature; outlines our alternative framework; and applies it to a case study of East Timor.", "authors": ["Shahar Hameiri"], "citations": 1, "venue": "", "year": 2016}, "7": {"title": "Who is to blame? Medical hype in the media", "abstract": "The rise of online and social media platforms as tools for the dissemination and exchange of findings from health research presents both unique opportunities and critical challenges. A Viewpoint featured in the September issue of Movement Disorders highlights one of these challenges: the hype and sensationalism that surround medical treatments, and treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) specifically, in the media. This issue is timely, as media consumption has largely shifted to the online environment, and recent survey data show that 91% of physicians have seen patients who made inquiries about information they found on the Internet. Although online health information may spur important conversations between patients and physicians, low-quality communication about potential treatments for conditions such as PD may lead to important harms. The authors of the Viewpoint highlight issues such as false hopes, tensions in the patientphysician relationship, and potential increases in medical tourism, all of which are supported by empirical evidence. Overly hyped or factually incorrect online health information can also lead to the early adoption, use, and promotion of unproven interventions, as well as to negative health outcomes. As one example, a study about websites containing information about popular herbal supplements showed that one-quarter of these websites provide recommendations that, if followed, will lead directly to physical harms. On the societal level, overly simplified or hyped findings from medical research can dilute verifiable expertise to the point that the authority of experts over the subject matter appears questionable to those who are uncertain about whom to trust. This, in turn, can lead to a reduction in public confidence in both scientists and institutions, sometimes with disastrous consequences, as has been the case with childhood immunizations. Addressing the urgent challenges raised by low-quality online information requires a careful examination of the role of scientists, information providers, and patient communities in knowledge dissemination and exchange. To better understand the phenomenon of medical hype in the media, we must first consider the broader context in which it takes place. The deep specialization of scientific research, the evolving landscape of academic publishing, and the changing media environment, along with contextual pressures, have created complex new challenges for scientists and information providers alike. In modern academia, the \u201cpublish-or-perish\u201d environment combined with the explosion in the number of low-quality or even fraudulent academic journal publishers has led to a flooding of the literature with evidence gathered with varying levels of rigor. In parallel with this development, scientists face tremendous pressures to appeal to a wide range of stakeholders, including funding bodies, the industry, and the public. Taken together, these pressures can reduce complicated scientific discovery to simple sound bites or headlines, overly simplified reports, and exaggerated claims of real-world impact in a range of communication types, from media interviews to grant proposal summaries. Wide-ranging attempts to disseminate new research findings can result in miscommunication and misinterpretation, especially among nonexperts. Meanwhile, scientists who actively pursue high-quality opportunities for public engagement and science communication are viewed as less serious compared with their peers who favor traditional academic communication channels. On this topic, a survey by the Royal Society revealed that researchers felt that \u201cpublic engagement activities are seen by peers as bad for their career\u201d and that \u201cpublic engagement was done by those who were \u2018not good enough\u2019 for an academic career.\u201d The stigma attached to scientists to pursue media and public engagement activities persists to this day, despite the fact that the research community recognizes the benefits of an informed public that values medical research. Alongside the complex pressures scientists face when communicating their results, the media environment, too, is changing.

Our scoping review addresses this gap by examining how the body of research on ASRH in SSA has evolved over the past decade, and its present profile, in terms of trends in volume, geographic and substantive focus, and Africa-led inquiry. Methods We used a three-step search strategy to identify English and French peer-reviewed publications and relevant grey literature on ASRH in SSA published between January 2010 and December 2019. Two reviewers screened the titles, abstracts and full texts of publications for eligibility and inclusion. Results A total of 1302 articles were published over the period, rising from 91 in 2010 to 183 in 2015. However, the bulk of the studies (63.9%) focused on six (South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia) of the 46 SSA countries. Ten countries had no ASRH papers, while five others each had only one publication. While issues like HIV (17.2%), sexual behaviours (17.4%) and access to sexual and reproductive health services (13.0%) received substantial attention, only a few studies focused on early adolescence (10\u201314 years), programme interventions, scaling up of interventions and policy evaluation. Just over half of publications had authors with African institutional affiliations as first authors (51.1%) or last author (53.0%). Sixteen per cent of papers did not include any authors from institutions in Africa. Conclusions Our review demonstrated that research on ASRH is limited in focus and is unevenly distributed across SSA countries. The identified gaps can guide future research and funding to advance ASRH policies and programmes. It is also vital for stakeholders in the research enterprise, including researchers, donors, ethical review boards, and journal editors and reviewers, to implement measures that foster national investigators\u2019 inclusion.", "authors": ["A.

However, research with HCPs shows that many are reluctant to enquire about abuse and feel underprepared to deal with disclosures. Self-assessment offers a participatory approach that may be employed as part of a suite of educational interventions to increase HCP knowledge and confidence. As a complex intervention involving multiple steps and actors, its effectiveness is contingent on organisational contexts. Realist reviews offer a theory-driven and contextually sensitive approach for understanding the mechanisms of change that generate specific outcomes, enabling reviewers to identify generalisable insights on how and why programmes work.\nMethods\n\nWe adopted a realist approach to answer the following questions: how are CSA/E self-assessment tools currently being used by HCPs, what does \u2018good practice\u2019 in the use of such tools look like, under what circumstances are existing tools effective, and why? Guided by Pawson\u2019s 5 stages, we conducted a realist review of abuse-related self-assessment tools for HCPs. Following preliminary scoping of the literature, we developed an initial programme theory which informed our search strategy and theoretical framework.\nResults\n\n25 items met criteria for data extraction, and relevant contexts (C), mechanisms (M) and outcomes (O) were identified and mapped. Eight of these were included in the final synthesis. We identified two key \u2018families\u2019 of abuse-related self-assessment for healthcare contexts: PREMIS, a validated survey instrument to assess HCP knowledge, confidence and practice in relation to domestic violence and abuse (DVA); Trauma-informed practice/care (TIP/C) organisational self-assessment protocols. Two revised programme theories were formulated: 1. Individual self-assessment can promote organisational accountability 2. Organisational self-assessment can increase the coherence and sustainability of changes in practice.\nConclusions\n\nOur review contributes to the evidence base on improving healthcare responses to CSA/E survivors, illustrating that self-assessment tools or protocols specifically designed to improve HCP responses to adult survivors of CSA/E remain under-developed and under-studied. Refined programme theories developed during synthesis regarding DVA and TIP/C related tools or protocols suggest areas for CSA/E-specific future research with stakeholders and service users.", "authors": ["Olumide O.

These living environments or settings play a crucial role for health promotion and prevention purposes since they affect the health of its members, as the World Health Organization (WHO) declares. Implementing digital health promotion and prevention interventions in settings offers the opportunity to reach specific target groups, to lower the costs of implementation and to improve the health of the population. Until now it lacks scientific evidence that reviews and maps the research field of digital health promotion and prevention in settings.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n The overall objective of this scoping review is to provide an overview of research targeting digital health promotion and primary prevention in settings. It focusses on assessing the range of the scientific literature regarding various outcomes like applied technology, targeted setting and area of health promotion or prevention and on identifying research gaps that result from these findings.\n \n \n METHODS\n The scoping review was conducted following the framework by Levac et al. [1]. We searched in eight scientific databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, SocINDEX, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, IEEE Xplore, BASE and Web of Science), grey literature sources and reference lists for literature on digital setting-based health promotion and prevention published between 2010 and January 2020. The screening of articles was based on a priori defined eligibility criteria. Thus, we included empirical and non-empirical publications published in English or German and excluded articles on secondary or tertiary prevention and on health promotion at the workplace.\n \n \n RESULTS\n From an initial number of 8,888 records, the literature search led to 200 included publications. Overall, we identified a huge diversity and breadth of literature regarding digital setting-based health promotion and prevention. The variety of technology types extents from computer programs to smartphone applications up to sensor devices. We found various analogue, digital or blended settings in which digital health promotion and prevention takes place. The most frequent analogue settings are schools (19.5%) and neighborhoods or communities (12%). Social media applications are also included because in some studies social media is defined as a (digital) setting. Social media applications account for 31.5% of the identified settings. The most commonly focused area of health promotion and prevention are physical activity (40.5%), nutrition (22.5%) and sexual health (17%). The majority of interventions combine several health promotion or prevention methods including environmental change, providing information, social support, training, incentives and monitoring. Finally, we found that articles mostly report on behavioral rather than structural health promotion and prevention in settings.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n The research field of digital health promotion and prevention in settings is very broad and heterogeneous. At the same time we identified research gaps regarding the absence of valid definitions of relevant terms (e.g. digital settings) and the lack of literature on structural health promotion and prevention. Therefore, it remains unclear how digital technologies can contribute to structural (or organizational) changes in settings. More research is needed to successfully implement digital technologies in order to reach health promotion and prevention in settings.\n", "authors": ["Cornelia Geukes", "Anna Lea Stark", "Christoph Dockweiler"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2020}, "3": {"title": "Map reduce programming model: Construction of inverted index for automated document clustering", "abstract": "Inverted index is an important data structure used in Information Retrieval operation, which enable all retrieval engines to easily facilitate full-text search.

The GPM decouples the search space of the EC algorithm into a many-to-one mapping, allowing an abstraction of the search and solution spaces, which can bring a number of benefits to search. Grammatical Evolution (GE) is a grammar based form of Genetic Programming (GP) that incorporates a GPM at its core, which is loosely inspired by nature. This thesis investigates whether di\u21b5erent approaches to the GPM can have a positive e\u21b5ect on GE\u2019s performance. By examining a range of GPMs that use di\u21b5ering expansion order principles it was found the one approach, Position Independent Grammatical Evolution (\u21e1GE) presented a viable alternative to the canonical GE GPM. \u21e1GE, while showing good performance, uses a variable expansion order controlled by evolution. This variable ordering increases the size of the search space that must be navigated by \u21e1GE during evolution. It is found that \u21e1GE gains a significant increase in connectivity by using an evolvable order, while also providing \u21e1GE with additional neutrality. Knowing what orders \u21e1GE uses during evolution may provide insight into new GPM approaches. With this in mind a set of measures are devised, that allow for the monitoring of \u21e1GE\u2019s population during an evolutionary run. What is found is that \u21e1GE doesn\u2019t converge to a single order but rather a distribution of GPM orders. The addition of the evolvable order in \u21e1GE provides an added degree of freedom in the mapping that is not exploited by standard genetic operations. A mutation operation is presented that will allow the algorithm to focus mutation on certain aspects of the \u21e1GE chromosome. It is found that with this ability the performance of \u21e1GE is increased.

Michael saw something in me, and decided I was worth investing time and money in. I am forever indebted to you for all the support, encouragement, and supervision you have given me. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better supervisor, you knew when to push me and when to just let me figure things out by myself. Sean you were always there to bounce ideas o\u21b5, and get hands on as I tried to muddle my way through certain mathematical challenges. I must also thank Prof. Anthony Brabazon, while not my supervisor you always showed interest in my work, providing invaluable advice and encouragement. I want to thank all the members, past and present, of the Natural Computing Research and Applications group for the support, guidance, and welcoming environment they provided. Dr. James McDermott, Dr. Miguel Nicolau, Dr. Erik Hemberg, and Dr. Alexandros Agapitos, as post-docs you all provided me with a sounding board for my ideas and I am grateful for the feedback and friendship that has come of it. Special thanks must also be given to Dr. Jonathan Byrne and Dr. John Mark Swa\u21b5ord. We were in the trenches together doing our PhDs. You welcomed me into the group with open arms and I am very grateful for the friends you have become. I honestly don\u2019t think I would have enjoyed my time in research as much if it was not for Dr. Eoin Murphy. We have been through a lot together, BSc and PhD, and remained good friends throughout. I could not be happier knowing that we will graduate together. I do not like for my work life to interfere with my private life, mainly so I don\u2019t have to explain to friends what I do, but also so that I can escape and unwind when not in work. So I wish to thanks all my friends (you know who you are) for doing nothing. I know your help and support was always o\u21b5ered but I like to not burden you guys with having to fain interest in my research. The time we spent just sitting around having a laugh was exactly what I needed. My family plays an important part in my life. Kevin, Laura, Fiona, Rachel, Sarah, Keith, and Emma; thank you, I could not have done this without your love and support. I would not change a thing about the cloud of madness we exist in as a family. Most importantly I must thank my parents. Everything I do and achieve in life is to try an make you guys proud. The love and support you have shown me throughout my life has made me into the man I am today. Without your presence I am certain I would not be here today with this PhD thesis. Mam you pestered me about not wasting my intelligence after my first unsuccessful attempt at this college lark. My returning to education to do my undergraduate degree was a direct result of this. Without that I would never have achieved what has followed that decision. I can\u2019t express in words how much I love you Mam, and how grateful I am to have you as a mother. Tragically my father passed away the week after my viva. Dad I love you and miss you immensely. I know it brought you so much happiness the day I passed my viva. Dad, I am forever grateful for everything you did for me. You provided me with whatever you possibly could, and tried to nurture any interest I had. I am deeply saddened that you won\u2019t be around for my graduation, but I know you will be there with me in spirit. Finally, I would like to thank Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).

This queer Irish road film collapses opposition between mobility and home by uncoupling them from heteronormative structures of gender, desire, and space\u2014male/female, public/private. The film\u2019s protagonist, Patrick \u201cKitten\u201d Braden (Cillian Murphy), wanders in search of a loved one without whom she does not feel at home. Along the way, the film exposes and exploits the doubleness of both \u201cmobility\u201d and \u201chome\u201d in the traditional road narrative, queering the conventions of the road film to convey the desire and possibilities for an alternative domesticity. In its rerouting of the traditional road plot, Breakfast on Pluto does not follow a hero escaping the obligations of home and family to find autonomy on the road. Instead, the film charts Kitten\u2019s quest to realise a sense of home through trans-domesticity\u2014that is, to find shelter in non-heteronormative, mutual care while in both transient and public spaces.I affix \u201ctrans-\u201d to \u201cdomesticity\u201d to signal both the queerness and mobility that transform understandings of domestic spaces and practices in Breakfast on Pluto. To clarify, trans-domesticity is not queer assimilation to heteronormative domesticity, nor is it a relegation of queer culture to privatised and demobilised spaces. Rather, trans-domesticity challenges the assumption that all forms of domesticity are inherently normalising and demobilising. In other words, trans-domesticity uncovers tensions and violence swept under the rugs of hegemonic domesticity. Moreover, this alternative domesticity moves between and beyond the terms of gender and spatial oppositions that delimit the normative home.Specifically, \u201ctrans-domesticity\u201d names non-normative homemaking practices that arise out of the \u201cdesire to feel at home\u201d, a desire that Anne-Marie Fortier identifies in queer diasporic narratives (1890-90). Accordingly, \u201ctrans-domesticity\u201d also registers the affective processes that foster the connectedness and belonging of \u201chome\u201d away from private domestic spaces and places of origin, a \u201crethinking of the concept of home\u201d, which Ed Madden traces in lesbian and gay migrant narratives (175-77). Building on the assumption of queer diaspora theorists \u201cthat not only can one be at home in movement, but that movement can be one\u2019s very own home\u201d (Rapport and Dawson 27), trans-domesticity focuses critical attention on the everyday practices and emotional labour that create a home in transience.As Breakfast on Pluto tracks its transgender protagonist\u2019s movement between a small Irish border town, Northern Ireland, and London, the film invokes both a specifically Irish migration and the broader queer diaspora of which it is a part. While trans-domesticity is a recurring theme across a wide range of queer diasporic narratives, in Breakfast on Pluto it also simultaneously drives the plot and functions as a narrative frame. The film begins and ends with Kitten telling her story as she wanders through the streets of Soho and cares for a member of her made family, her friend Charlie\u2019s baby.Although I am concerned with the film adaptation, Patrick McCabe\u2019s \u201cPrelude\u201d to his novel, Breakfast on Pluto (1998), offers a useful point of departure: Patrick \u201cPussy\u201d Braden\u2019s dream, \u201cas he negotiates the minefields of this world\u201d, is \u201cending, once and for all, this ugly state of perpetual limbo\u201d and \u201cfinding a map which might lead to that place called home\u201d (McCabe x). In such a place, McCabe\u2019s hero might lay \u201chis head beneath a flower-bordered print that bears the words at last \u2018You\u2019re home\u2019\u201d(McCabe xi). By contrast, the film posits that \u201chome\u201d is never a \u201cplace\u201d apart from \u201cthe minefields of this world\u201d, and that while being in transit and in limbo might be a perpetual state, it is not necessarily an ugly one.Jordan\u2019s film thus addresses the same questions as does Susan Fraiman in her book\u00a0Extreme Domesticity: \u201cBut what about those for whom dislocation is not back story but main event? Those who, having pulled themselves apart, realize no timely arrival at a place of their own, so that being not-unpacked is an ongoing condition?\u201d (155). Through her trans-domestic shelter-making and caregiving practices, Kitten enacts \u201chome\u201d in motion and in public spaces, and thereby realises the elision in the flower-bordered print in McCabe\u2019s \u201cPrelude\u201d (xi), which does not assure \u201cYou are at home\u201d but, rather, \u201cYou are home\u201d.From Housed to Trans-Domestic SubjectivitySelf and home are equated in the dominant cultural narratives of Western modernity, but \u201chome\u201d in such formulations is assumed to be a self-owned, self-contained space. Psychoanalytic theorist Carl Jung describes this Ur-house as \u201ca concretization of the individuation process, [\u2026] a symbol of psychic wholeness\u201d (225). Philosopher Gaston Bachelard sees in the home \u201cthe topography of our intimate being\u201d, a structure that \u201cconcentrates being within limits that protect\u201d (xxxii). However, as historian Carolyn Steedman suggests, the mythic house that has become \u201cthe stuff of our \u2018cultural psychology,\u2019 the system of everyday metaphors by which we see ourselves\u201d, is far from universal; rather, it reflects \u201cthe topography of the houses\u201d of those who stand \u201cin a central relationship to the dominant culture\u201d (75, 17).For others, the lack of such housing correlates with political marginalisation, as the house functions as both a metaphor and material marker for culturally-recognised selfhood. As cultural geographer John Agnew argues, in capitalist societies the self-owned home is both a sign of autonomous individuality and a prerequisite for full political subjectivity (60). Philosopher Rosi Braidotti asserts that this figuration of subjectivity in \u201cthe phallo-Eurocentric master code\u201d treats as \u201cdisposable\u201d the \u201cbodies of women, youth, and others who are racialised or marked off by age, gender, sexuality, and income\u201d (6). These bodies are \u201creduced to marginality\u201d and subsequently \u201cexperience dispossession of their embodied and embedded selves, in a political economy of repeated and structurally enforced eviction\u201d (Braidotti 6).To shift the meaning of \u201chome\u201d and the intimately-linked \u201cself\u201d from a privately-owned, autonomous structure to trans-domesticity, to an ethos of care enacted even, and especially in, transient and public spaces, is not to romanticise homelessness or to deny the urgent necessity of material shelter. Breakfast on Pluto certainly does not allow viewers to do either. Rather, the figure of a trans-domestic self, like Braidotti\u2019s \u201cnomadic subject\u201d, has the potential to challenge and transform the terms of power relations. Those now on the margins might then be seen as equally-embodied selves and full political subjects with the right to shelter and care.Such a political project also entails recognising and revaluing\u2014without appropriating and demobilising\u2014existing trans-domesticity. As Fraiman argues, \u201cdomesticity\u201d must be \u201cmap[ped] from the margins\u201d in order to include the homemaking practices of gender rebels and the precariously housed, of castaways and outcasts (4-5). This alternative map would allow \u201coutsiders to normative domesticity\u201d to \u201cclaim domesticity while wrenching it away from such things as compulsory heterosexuality [\u2026] and the illusion of a safely barricaded life\u201d (Fraiman 4-5). Breakfast on Pluto shares in this re-mapping work by exposing the violence embedded in heteronormative domestic structures, and by charting the radical political potential of trans-domesticity.Unsettling HousesIn the traditional road narrative, \u201chome\u201d tends to be a static, confining structure from which the protagonist escapes, a space that then functions as \u201ca structuring absence\u201d on the road (Robertson 271). Bachelard describes this normative structure as a \u201cdream house\u201d that constitutes \u201ca body of images that give mankind proofs or illusions of stability\u201d (17); the house functions, Henri Lefebvre argues, as \u201cthe epitome of immobility\u201d (92). Whether the dream is to escape and/or to return, \u201cto write of houses\u201d, as Adam Hanna asserts, \u201cis to raise ideas of shelters that are fixed and secure\u201d (113).Breakfast on Pluto quickly gives lie to those expectations. Kitten is adopted by Ma Braden (Ruth McCabe), a single woman who raises Kitten and her adopted sister in domestic space that is connected to, and part of, a public house. That spatial contiguity undermines any illusion of privacy and security, as is evident in the scene in which a school-aged Kitten, who thought herself safely home alone and thus able to dress in her mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s clothes, is discovered in the act by her mother and sister from the pub\u2019s street entrance. Further, the film lays bare the built-in mechanisms of surveillance and violence that reinforce heteronormative, patriarchal structures. After discovering Kitten in women\u2019s clothes, Ma Braden violently scrubs her clean and whacks her with a brush until Kitten says, \u201cI\u2019m a boy, not a girl\u201d. The public/house space facilitates Ma Braden\u2019s close monitoring of Kitten thereafter.As a young writer in secondary school, Kitten satirises the violence within the hegemonic home by narrating the story of the rape of her biological mother, Eily Bergin (Eva Birthistle), by Kitten\u2019s father, Father Liam (Liam Neeson) in a scene of hyper-domesticity set in the rectory kitchen. As Patrick Mullen notes, \u201cthe rendition of the event follows the bubble-gum logic and tone of 1950s Hollywood culture\u201d (130). The relationship between the ideal domesticity thereby invoked and the rape then depicted exposes the sexual violence for what it is: not an external violation of the double sanctity of church and home space, but rather an internal and even intrinsic violence that reinforces and is shielded by the power structures from which normative domesticity is never separate.The only sense of home that seems to bind Kitten to her place of origin is based in her affective bonds to friends Charlie (Ruth Negga) and L", "authors": ["Kristina Deffenbacher"], "citations": 0, "venue": "M/C Journal", "year": 2019}, "8": {"title": "Chromosomal distribution and evolution of abundant retrotransposons in plants: gypsy elements in diploid and polyploid Brachiaria forage grasses", "abstract": "Like other eukaryotes, the nuclear genome of plants consists of DNA with a small proportion of low-copy DNA (genes and regulatory sequences) and very abundant DNA sequence motifs that are repeated thousands up to millions of times in the genomes including transposable elements (TEs) and satellite DNA. Retrotransposons, one class of TEs, are sequences that amplify via an RNA intermediate and reinsert into the genome, are often the major fraction of a genome. Here, we put research on retrotransposons into the larger context of plant repetitive DNA and genome behaviour, showing features of genome evolution in a grass genus, Brachiaria, in relation to other plant species. We show the contrasting amplification of different retroelement fractions across the genome with characteristics for various families and domains. The genus Brachiaria includes both diploid and polyploid species, with similar chromosome types and chromosome basic numbers x\u2009=\u20096, 7, 8 and 9. The polyploids reproduce asexually and are apomictic, but there are also sexual species. Cytogenetic studies and flow cytometry indicate a large variation in DNA content (C-value), chromosome sizes and genome organization. In order to evaluate the role of transposable elements in the genome and karyotype organization of species of Brachiaria, we searched for sequences similar to conserved regions of TEs in RNAseq reads library produced in Brachiaria decumbens. Of the 9649 TE-like contigs, 4454 corresponded to LTR-retrotransposons, and of these, 79.5\u00a0% were similar to members of the gypsy superfamily. Sequences of conserved protein domains of gypsy were used to design primers for producing the probes. The probes were used in FISH against chromosomes of accesses of B. decumbens, Brachiaria brizantha, Brachiaria ruziziensis and Brachiaria humidicola. Probes showed hybridization signals predominantly in proximal regions, especially those for retrotransposons of the clades CRM and Athila, while elements of Del and Tat exhibited dispersed signals, in addition to those proximal signals. These results show that the proximal region of Brachiaria chromosomes is a hotspot for retrotransposon insertion, particularly for the gypsy family. The combination of high-throughput sequencing and a chromosome-centric cytogenetic approach allows the abundance, organization and nature of transposable elements to be characterized in unprecedented detail. By their amplification and dispersal, retrotransposons can affect gene expression; they can lead to rapid diversification of chromosomes between species and, hence, are useful for studies of genome evolution and speciation in the Brachiaria genus. Centromeric regions can be identified and mapped, and retrotransposon markers can also assisting breeders in the developing and exploiting interspecific hybrids.", "authors": ["F. Santos", "R.

First, \u201cbet on the people.\u201d If Lloyd wanted to make something happen, he searched for someone he could count on to accomplish the task. No matter how appealing an idea or a strategy, he tried to make sure that the right people were involved. Second, \u201cwriting is always a process of continuous improvement.\u201d No matter how many times he revised his own writing or someone else\u2019s, he could always find a better way of sharpening the focus or adding a more felicitous phrase. Third, \u201clook for the larger connections or the bigger picture.\u201d Lloyd invariably took a comparative perspective. That is what drove his efforts to make planning education and MIT more of a global enterprise. Few academic planners have left such a mark on their universities and the study of city and regional planning as Lloyd Rodwin. He was born in 1919 and graduated from City College of New York in 1939 after majoring in history and philosophy. It was there that he developed a love for intellectual debate and Socratic dialogue. After taking a course on housing from Charles Abrams at the New School, he worked in one of the defense housing agencies in Washington, D.C. Lloyd then studied institutional economics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. His reading and research in Madison nurtured his vision of city planning\u2014one rather different from what prevailed at the time. Planners of that era were generally trained in the architectural tradition that relied mostly on the tools of design\u2014maps, photos, and land-use plans. Lloyd was among a group of students trained in the social sciences who believed that planners should study the lives of the people in the cities and regions they serve and not learn just the place-making tools at the heart of professional practice at the time. His critique of the British New Towns policy (Rodwin 1956) provoked some stinging reactions from formidable figures in the field\u2014Catherine Bauer Wurster and Lewis Mumford (Newbrun and Oberlander 2000, 230\u201335). His critics, however, propelled his career by encouraging him to complete an MPA and PhD at Harvard\u2019s Littauer School of Public Administration. This eventually led to his appointment in 1957 as assistant professor of land economics in MIT\u2019s Department of City and Regional Planning. During his tenure as chair of the MIT department (1969\u2013 1973), Lloyd reshaped it\u2014even changing its name to the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) to reflect his strong sense that the field required an interdisciplinary research focus closely tied to action on the ground. Before taking on the challenge of revamping planning education at MIT, Lloyd had cofounded (with Martin Meyerson, the twelfth recipient of ACSP\u2019s Distinguished Educator award) the MIT-Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies, a research institute where scholars like Kevin Lynch, William Alonzo, James Q. Wilson, Edward Banfield, Oscar Handlin, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and its founders could work together with their doctoral students and generate even more \u201cintellectual capital,\u201d as he would say.

Subsequent police interrogation led to his initial conviction of 48 counts of murder, with an additional count of murder added to the list later. Ridgway ultimately confessed to nearly twice that number, which made him one of the most prolific serial killers in American history. His common modus operandi was to lure his victims back to his house for a sexual transaction and subsequently to strangle them to death. His victims were then disposed of in wooded and remote areas, and in some cases, he returned to the dumpsites to perform sexual intercourse (i.e., necrophilic acts) on the corpses.

But some crimes have their way of being kept secret from the eyes of those hunting down the ones behind this atrocity, namely serial killers. This would not be possible unless the murder was planned out in such a way that was undetectable by the police and for that to happen it was necessary that the person committing the murders had higherorder thinking skills and a unique way of planning a murder so clean and perfect. Ted Bundy, being the handsome heartthrob of many young women despite them knowing his background of killing spree is the main subject of this research paper and through the unveiling of his psychopathic pattern of crime and his pattern of victim choosing, the murders of one of the greatest serial killers of all time are studied and exposed to have a better understanding of what methodology worked through the criminal mastermind\u2019s head. Keywords\u2014 Serial killer, Ted Bundy, young women, higher-order thinking skills, psychopathic. The infamous serial killer of America made his entry into the world of nightmare for young women in the 1960s terrorizing them and at the same time also being widely popular and most wanted by young women even after they had heard of his infamous and heinous crimes in and around the city. No amount of sense could be knocked into the heads of these young girls who despite having witnessed and heard of his horrendous methods of killing girls of their age and practicing sexual acts with their corpses, were ready to understand what kind of danger they were dragging themselves into and that the absurd fantasy they were trying to build around and for him was something that should never have been fantasized in the first place. Theodore Ted Bundy isn\u2019t the serial killer kind where one would expect the killer to look the part of a killer, dressed shabbily, ragged features with the description of a person who is able to commit such monstrosities painted on his face rather he was quite the gentleman, with ocean blue eyes, a charm that drew women to him in a snap of a finger accompanied by an aura which befuddled women into thinking that he only ever had good intentions. Killing women was nothing short of a psychotic fun activity for him where the thrill of abducting women in the hope of fulfilling his psychopathic sexual and homicidal fantasies was what kept him going and gave him that edge or the adrenaline rush in carrying out his crimes. His gruesome methods and the reason for his choice of victims were continually trying to be analyzed during his crime period by various investigators to find out his killing pattern and prevent it beforehand but then by the time they had gotten around to that, a large number of women had already fallen prey to his traps. The killer was captured at last but at what cost, the lives of so many young women who had to be test subjects and sacrificial lambs for the protection of those who were yet to be brutally murdered. What made his crimes go unnoticed is the larger question that is put forward through this paper and why were his crimes one of the most difficult cases to be solved is what is being analyzed. This paper looks at how higher intellect as well as a poor family background constructed a clear path for Ted Bundy to pull off his crimes with little or no difficulty. His sick psychotic brain functioned in a pattern like no other ordinary human brain because of which his International Journal of English Literature and Social Sciences, 5(6) Nov-Dec 2020 | Available online: https://ijels.com/ ISSN: 2456-7620 https://dx.doi.org/10.22161/ijels.56.57 2213 crime patterns were hard nuts to crack and allowed him to go about conducting new, psychotic sexual activities with the corpses or trophies that he refers to them as. Punished for his crimes he was, but what brought about these crimes in the first place is the first black dot in the life chart of Ted Bundy. The objective of this paper is to analyze the horrifying Bundy Murders in the light of his higher intellect in conjunction with a deficient childhood which constructed the platform for Ted Bundy to perpetrate his psychotic crimes in the most spotless way possible. The analysis of this will be in accordance with an autobiographical work that discusses a comprehensive history of the murders of Ted Bundy. This autobiographical text provides detailed descriptions of the complete history behind the mad killing spree, the methods, and weapons used for carrying out those heinous crimes, the pattern of murder and the choice of victims, and most importantly the life of young Ted Bundy: the very age where matters took a drastic turn for worse and happening to have a brilliantly high IQ just provided leverage and assisted the killer in making murders a neurotic and psychotic game of hiding but never to seek. For studying certain crime patterns of an individual, it is necessary to acquire information about the person and his background. For the purpose of my study, I will be looking into the information provided for Ted Bundy on the basis of an autobiography written on his account. The research methodology thus availed in this paper is qualitative in nature and is an autobiographical account of the serial killer, Ted Bundy. Articles written on other serial killers express similar ideas of crime patterns and childhood behaviors which have led to the corruption of young minds which in turn led to their murderous intentions. An article written by Hayriye Elif on Serial Killers: Nature vs Nurture talks about how serial killers are naturally made killers owing to some of their horrible family backgrounds. This background can be of childhood abuse that they experienced or any other such traumatic events in their younger years. In most articles written on similar topics, the same view was seen to be very accurate as even researchers have approved of this claim. She mentions that the intention to kill or do off with someone if comes naturally to some is mostly nurtured in others because of what they encountered in their childhood. This is where the article threw the spotlight on parents or other family members because they would all be collectively responsible for shaping or even creating an identity for their children. This would mean that a part of their future was mainly shaped by the occurrences and incidents in their childhood which thereby flagged their homicidal instincts at a later age. Other articles written on the crime patterns and choice of victims gave an insight into what would be considered as the basis for the choice of certain patterns or victims. An article by Mark Seltzer on Serial Killers (2): The Pathological Public Sphere talks about how a certain serial killer has his mark on young women who have opted for a modern form of occupation such as fashion or those who work in technological fields. According to researchers, these murders or choice of victims is largely due to wanting to not break from the conventional rules set by the society for women to be at home and do household chores or other jobs such as nursing which would bring out the femininity in them. Those who could not follow this was welcomed with the punishment of murder by these serial killers. Another article by Thomas Doherty namely Licensed to Kill: An Interview with Arthur Dong talks about his interviews with a homophobic serial killer named Arthur who took it on himself to make it a main preoccupation to murder people who are homosexuals as part of being a person of faith. This article acts as a supporting claim to this statement that serial killers adopt a certain pattern of killing depending on the twisted ideals that they either believe in or want to enforce on others. But rather than approaching them, they find it easier to wipe the person off the planet to avoid interaction and interference of human emotions. These articles therefore also gave an idea of how poor communication skills and alienation from society created the unnecessary space for these killers to advance towards their victims using physical force. The primary text namely The Bundy Murders: A Comprehensive History by Kevin M Sullivan talks about the whole history of the psychopathic serial killer Ted Bundy who was apparently going around killing young women in the \u201990s. The author talks about the numerous things that contributed to Ted\u2019s choice of a serial killer lifestyle and how it came about in the first place. The autobiographical account covers everything from his broken family background to his execution in an electric chair. Sullivan talks about how Bundy had been void of emotion in a few years\u2019 time after entering college. The emotional quotient was missing in him which is what caused him to go on a killing spree and conduct such heinous crimes. In the summer of 1974, Ted had already found the love of his life Liz but was unable to dedicate himself to her alone. The dark sinister intentions of wanting to abduct women and commit sexual activities with them were also getting stronger around this time. Around this time, Ted was into wild pornography where International Journal of English Literature and Social Sciences, 5(6) Nov-Dec 2020 | Available online: https://ijels.com/ ISSN: 2456-7620 https://dx.doi.org/10.22161/ijels.56.57 2214 female dominance over men was portrayed and where scenes of bondage kept him excited and thrilled. At a very young age, Ted was already referring to one of his class teachers as a \u201cvoluptuous disciplinarian\u201d and was seen committing sexual activities in the storeroom inside the classroom. Being a boy with brains accompanied by good looks had already scored him a lot of female attention in class which he later on claims is why he knew girls would or could easily be fooled as long as they found the person and his acts genuine from the outside.

Moreover, the authors bring out the control issue that inexperienced lead investigators partially contributed to the Yorkshire case becoming a six-year investigation, encompassing 13 murders and 7 serious assaults. Keppel and Birnes discuss the role of professional consultants and factors that influence the need for such individuals. In many cases, public pressure resulting from perceived lack of success on the part of police leads to the hiring of professional consultants. These individuals can range from mental health professionals and FBI profilers to individuals who claim ESP as their primary investigative tool. The Atlanta Child Murder Task Force Investigation (July 1, 1979 to May 1, 1981) was the first serial murder case to use professional consultants. The primary questions to be answered by consultants in this case involved strategies for profiling the serial killer and methods of catching him. In this case, Commissioner Lee Brown employed a team of seven highly experienced investigators to assist in the case. Review of this case and others suggests that experienced consulting detectives are by far the best in providing assistance. Throughout the book, the authors examine the concepts of denial and defeat and their effects on the investigative process. They suggest that, ifthese concepts are a predictable offspring of such investigations, steps can be taken to manage them. Particular attention is paid to advance planning and the need to have procedures and protocol in place prior to dealing with such cases. Further focus is placed on the need to have established lines of communications, trained computer professionals, and agency liaisons in place. Keppel and Bimes round out this volume by discussing the framework, theory, and methods of performing serial killer investigations, as well as the \"best practices\" for the conduct of such investigations. .

This Article analyzes the Fourth Amendment implications of government use of such powerful technology to explore such sensitive information as DNA. The conclusion the Supreme Court could reach, should it be called upon to examine the privacy issues involved in such intrusions, would vary depending on which avenue of Fourth Amendment analysis it chose to pursue. Maryland v. King, Court precedent on government collection of DNA, is so narrow that it provides little guidance on the issues presented by genetic genealogy. Instead, the Court could consult its recent ruling in Carpenter v. United States, which limited the third party doctrine that had previously nullified privacy expectations in shared information. If it relied on Carpenter, the Court would likely prohibit government downloads from genealogy sites without a warrant. Further, the Court could view individuals\u2019 uploads of genetic information onto open source genealogy sites as amounting to consent to view the DNA shared with all relatives. The Court might therefore apply its third party consent precedent, which, in relying on widely shared societal expectations, would likely prevent warrantless collection of genetic information from genealogy sites.

Finally, the Court could see law enforcement\u2019s use of genetic genealogy as an issue of standing, as recently analyzed in Byrd v. United States. Application of Byrd\u2019s property rights definition of standing would likely enable the government to admit genetic evidence since suspects lack the power to exclude others from open source sites. Thus, although some Fourth Amendment doctrines would forbid warrantless collection of DNA information, the government could likely rely on either antecedent private search or standing precedent to successfully use genetic genealogy evidence.

This is done in order to preserve the stabilising action of the inherently stabilising nonlinearities. Robustness and performance margins are derived for this control scheme, and are expressed in terms of bounds on the plant nonlinearities and the accuracy of the cancellation of the unstable plant nonlinearity by the controller.

Two strategies are evaluated, the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller, built using the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), is compared to a wavecancellation scheme, obtained via the direct inversion of the frequency-domain transfer functions of the system. For the evaluated cases, it is shown that LQG leads to a wave-cancelling signal of the incoming Tollmien-Schlichting wavepacket. Such result allows further insight into the physics behind the active control of convectively unstable flows permitting, for instance, the optimization of the transverse position for actuation via a linear stability approach. 1 General Introduction The manipulation of the flow dynamics via passive or active control strategies poses a challenge with several foreseeable industrial and technological applications, and there is a particular interest in the delay of the laminar-turbulent transition of a boundary layer and consequent drag reduction, as the main expenses of a commercial airline are related to fuel consumptions [1]. In a low free-stream turbulence environment, transition of unswept wings is most often due to Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves which, depending on the Reynolds number of the flow, will grow exponentially until a critical amplitude will lead to non-linear interactions [2] and finally breakdown to turbulence. In general, the actuation is placed in a region where the amplitude of the TS waves is small, and the convective nature of the flow is accounted via a feedforward scheme, where the input signal is not affected by the actuation. Several examples of this type of control may be found in the literature; for instance Fabbiane et al. [4, 3] apply linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) and adaptive schemes and Li & Gaster [5] consider an inversion of transfer functions for the active control of 3D boundary-layers. The work of Fabbiane et al. [3] evaluates the energy budget related to active control and demonstrates that, even though the actuation is performed in a region of low amplitude of the TS waves, with the currently available flow control actuators, it can difficult to obtain drag reductions below the energy break-even point, for their evaluated cases. With this in mind, we propose an inversion technique based on the nature of the convectively unstable flow and show that the more complex LQG controller reduces to such strategy, in the frequencies of interest for control, leading to a wave-cancellation scheme. The control law is similar to the one proposed in Li & Gaster [5], however a penalization of the actuation signal is also included, which allows uncontrollable frequencies to be disregarded and increases the", "authors": ["K.

The ash spewed into the air during a volcanic eruption heavily restricts the surrounding air space that is usable for air traffic. The free air space must then be used efficiently to minimise the negative impacts on both the airlines and the passengers. DLR researchers in Braunschweig have used different simulations to identify the reasons for flight cancellations or delays due to volcanic ash and have developed action strategies for better handling problems encountered as a result of ash clouds.

The procedure is based on the idea of \u201cshaping\u201d the total energy of the closed-loop system with the nice feature that it achieves the tracking objective without the need of cancelling dynamics but by associating a natural reference (\u201csteady state\u201d) behaviour for all state variables. In this paper we use the procedure to solve the problem of torque regulation of a nonlinear induction motor model which includes both electrical and mechanical dynamics. We derive a nonlinear state observer plus state feedback control that insures exponential stability provided the desired torque does not exceed a given value. The latter condition can be removed if the motor full state is measurable. An adaptive version of the scheme that does not require exact knowledge of the rotor resistance or load torque is also shown to be asymptotically convergent. Three key features of the proposed scheme are: first, it attains the field orientation objective of the highly successful \u201cvector control\u201d strategies. Second, using the energy balance equation of the induction motor, identifies the nonlinear terms that represent \u201cworkless forces\u201d to avoid (intrinsically nonrobust) exact cancellation of model nonlinearities. Third, the control law calculation is extremely simple and globally defined, thus the strategy is applicable for all motor operation regimes including start-up.

Since most systems use point sensors like microphones to sense the noise field the quiet zone generated by system can be small. Outside the quite zones amplification of the noise may happen. In narrow band active noise control systems the dimension of the quite zone around each error sensor will be proportional to the wavelength of the noise being cancelled. In broadband active noise control systems several error sensors per anti-noise source are used (two as a rule of thumb) in order to achieve wider cancellations regions, but the fact still remains that the size of the quiet zone will be proportional to the wavelength of the noise. Actually using two microphones per anti-noise source makes the controller adapt in to a band limiting filter in order to prevent the generation of anti-noise with frequencies that are amplified inside the quite zone. In this paper, techniques to band limit the anti-noise are studied that do not need the extra number of error sensors. This extends previous work for the single channel case to the multi-channel case with several reference, error sensors and anti-noise sources. This can't be done by simpling placing a filter in the cancellation path, or using the anti-aliasing or reconstruction filters, unless you use a very sharp filter with long delay and a leakage factor. Instead several structures based on the MFx-LMS algorithm are presented that accomplish this task. The proposed structures also give some insight into the limitations of broadband active noise control systems due to the delay required to the band limiting action.", "authors": ["C.

The controller begins as a traditional feedback controller designed to cancel random disturbances. Additional filters operate in parallel with this feedback controller and attempt to detect predictable disturbances. When these predictable disturbances are identified, an additional feedback loop is invoked. This additional parallel feedback loop is designed to specifically cancel the identified disturbance.

In this paper we discuss the design of settling servo controller which provides fast settling performance without creating overshoot.

With international travel bans affecting over 90% of the world population and wide-spread restrictions on public gatherings and community mobility, tourism largely ceased in March 2020.

Recent studies have shown that in addition to dyspnea, hypoxemia, and acute respiratory distress, lymphopenia, and cytokine release syndrome are also important clinical features in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests that homeostasis of the immune system plays an important role in the development of COVID-19 pneumonia. To provide direct evidence on leukocyte homeostasis, we studied the immunological characteristics of peripheral blood leukocytes from 16 patients admitted to the Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases, Kunming, China. Among them, 10 were mild cases, 6 were severe cases; 7 were \u226550 years old, 11 were younger; and 6 had baseline diabetes, hypertension, or coronary atherosclerosis (Supplementary Table S1). Similar to the healthy group (n= 6), the absolute numbers of cells of major leukocyte subsets in peripheral blood remained at a normal level in both mild and severe patients. Different from that reported by Chen et al., we did not observe increased neutrophils or decreased lymphocytes. Instead, we found that the severe group had a significant reduction in granulocytes compared to the mild group (Fig. 1a). It has been reported that elevated inflammatory mediators play a crucial role in fatal pneumonia caused by pathogenic human coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). We therefore examined whether inflammatory mediators can impact progression in COVID-19 patients. However, no statistical differences in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) plasma concentrations were found among the three groups. Although patients had higher sCD14 levels than healthy people, there were no significant differences between the severe and mild groups (Fig. 1b). Virus-induced inflammatory factor storms can cause a systemic T cell response, reflected as changes in the differentiation and activity of T cells. Here, as significant differences in virus-induced inflammatory cytokines were not detected, we next examined whether homeostasis was perturbed in T cells at the cellular level (Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 1c, the proportions of multiple molecules related to T cell activation and regulation increased significantly in patients compared to healthy controls, but several functional molecules showed a marked decrease. Among the differentially expressed functional molecules, the levels of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and TNF-\u03b1 in CD4+ T cells were lower in the severe group than in the mild group, whereas the levels of granzyme B and perforin in CD8+ T cells were higher in the severe group than in the mild group. The activation molecules showed no differences in CD4+ T cells, whereas the levels of HLA-DR and TIGIT in CD8+ T cells were higher in the severe group than in the mild group (Fig. 1c). These data indicate that COVID-19, similar to some chronic infections, damages the function of CD4+ T cells and promotes excessive activation and possibly subsequent exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. Together, these perturbations of T cell subsets may eventually diminish host antiviral immunity. Usually a single molecule does not adequately predict disease progression. We therefore further performed cluster analysis on marker expression using data obtained from flow cytometry. Our results showed significant differences among the three subject groups in the level of exhaustion modules, including PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIGIT, and functional modules, including IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 (Supplementary Figs. S2, 3). Compared with the healthy control and mild group, the frequency of multi-functional CD4+ T cells (positive for at least two cytokines) decreased significantly in the severe group, whereas the proportion of non-functional (IFN-\u03b3 \u2212TNF-\u03b1\u2212IL-2\u2212) subsets increased significantly. Studies have shown that multi-functional T cells can better control human immunodeficiency virus in natural infection and are correlated with better outcomes during vaccination; thus, the functional damage of CD4+ T cells may have predisposed COVID-19 patients to severe disease. Li et al. showed that these multi-functional CD4+ T cells occur more frequently in patients with severe SARS infections than in moderate infections. This indicates that SARSCoV-2 may possess a unique immune pathology compared to other coronaviruses. In CD8+ T cells, the frequency of the nonexhausted (PD-1\u2212CTLA-4\u2212TIGIT\u2212) subset in the severe group was significantly lower than that in the other two groups (Fig. 1d). Because functional blockade of PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIGIT is beneficial for CD8+ T cells to maintain lasting antigen-specific immunity and antiviral effects, the excessive exhaustion of CD8+ T cells in severe patients may reduce their cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2.", "authors": ["Hong-Yi Zheng", "Mi Zhang", "Cui-Xian Yang", "N.

Science, this issue p. eabb9789 Modeling and Bayesian inference reveal the time dependence of SARS-CoV-2 interventions on the number of new infections. INTRODUCTION When faced with the outbreak of a novel epidemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), rapid response measures are required by individuals, as well as by society as a whole, to mitigate the spread of the virus. During this initial, time-critical period, neither the central epidemiological parameters nor the effectiveness of interventions such as cancellation of public events, school closings, or social distancing is known. RATIONALE As one of the key epidemiological parameters, we inferred the spreading rate \u03bb from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections using the example of Germany. We apply Bayesian inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to a class of compartmental models [susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)]. Our analysis characterizes the temporal change of the spreading rate and allows us to identify potential change points. Furthermore, it enables short-term forecast scenarios that assume various degrees of social distancing. A detailed description is provided in the accompanying paper, and the models, inference, and forecasts are available on GitHub (https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference_forecast). Although we apply the model to Germany, our approach can be readily adapted to other countries or regions. RESULTS In Germany, interventions to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were implemented in three steps over 3 weeks: (i) Around 9 March 2020, large public events such as soccer matches were canceled; (ii) around 16 March 2020, schools, childcare facilities, and many stores were closed; and (iii) on 23 March 2020, a far-reaching contact ban (Kontaktsperre) was imposed by government authorities; this included the prohibition of even small public gatherings as well as the closing of restaurants and all nonessential stores. From the observed case numbers of COVID-19, we can quantify the impact of these measures on the disease spread using change point analysis. Essentially, we find that at each change point the spreading rate \u03bb decreased by ~40%. At the first change point, assumed around 9 March 2020, \u03bb decreased from 0.43 to 0.25, with 95% credible intervals (CIs) of [0.35, 0.51] and [0.20, 0.30], respectively. At the second change point, assumed around 16 March 2020, \u03bb decreased to 0.15 (CI [0.12, 0.20]). Both changes in \u03bb slowed the spread of the virus but still implied exponential growth (see red and orange traces in the figure). To contain the disease spread, i.e., to turn exponential growth into a decline of new cases, the spreading rate has to be smaller than the recovery rate \u03bc = 0.13 (CI [0.09, 0.18]). This critical transition was reached with the third change point, which resulted in \u03bb = 0.09 (CI [0.06, 0.13]; see blue trace in the figure), assumed around 23 March 2020. From the peak position of daily new cases, one could conclude that the transition from growth to decline was already reached at the end of March. However, the observed transient decline can be explained by a short-term effect that originates from a sudden change in the spreading rate (see Fig. 2C in the main text). As long as interventions and the concurrent individual behavior frequently change the spreading rate, reliable short- and long-term forecasts are very difficult. As the figure shows, the three example scenarios (representing the effects up to the first, second, and third change point) quickly diverge from each other and, consequently, span a considerable range of future case numbers. Inference and subsequent forecasts are further complicated by the delay of ~2 weeks between an intervention and the first useful estimates of the new \u03bb (which are derived from the reported case numbers). Because of this delay, any uncertainty in the magnitude of social distancing in the previous 2 weeks can have a major impact on the case numbers in the subsequent 2 weeks. Beyond 2 weeks, the case numbers depend on our future behavior, for which we must make explicit assumptions. In sum, future interventions (such as lifting restrictions) should be implemented cautiously to respect the delayed visibility of their effects. CONCLUSION We developed a Bayesian framework for the spread of COVID-19 to infer central epidemiological parameters and the timing and magnitude of intervention effects. With such an approach, the effects of interventions can be assessed in a timely manner. Future interventions and lifting of restrictions can be modeled as additional change points, enabling short-term forecasts for case numbers. In general, our approach may help to infer the efficiency of measures taken in other countries and inform policy-makers about tightening, loosening, and selecting appropriate measures for containment of COVID-19. Bayesian inference of SIR model parameters from daily new cases of COVID-19 enables us to assess the impact of interventions. In Germany, three interventions (mild social distancing, strong social distancing, and contact ban) were enacted consecutively (circles). Colored lines depict the inferred models that include the impact of one, two, or three interventions (red, orange, or green, respectively, with individual data cutoff) or all available data until 21 April 2020 (blue). Forecasts (dashed lines) show how case numbers would have developed without the effects of the subsequent change points. Note the delay between intervention and first possible inference of parameters caused by the reporting delay and the necessary accumulation of evidence (gray arrows). Shaded areas indicate 50% and 95% Bayesian credible intervals. As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading across the globe, short-term modeling forecasts provide time-critical information for decisions on containment and mitigation strategies. A major challenge for short-term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change when first interventions show an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyzed the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections. Focusing on COVID-19 spread in Germany, we detected change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we could quantify the effect of interventions and incorporate the corresponding change points into forecasts of future scenarios and case numbers.

The Centers for Disease Control designates SCD as a condition at increased risk for severe COVID-19. An urgent need for repurposing of available and safe therapeutics has been cited for such high-risk populations until vaccines are widely available.\n L-glutamine (GLN) ameliorates clinical pathology of SCD related to elements of COVID-19. Multiple systemic complications of COVID-19 are increasingly attributed to oxidative damage, a target which GLN regulates. Prescription-grade L-glutamine (PGLG) (Endari\u00ae, Emmaus Medical) decreases oxidative stress by increasing the ratio of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to total NAD, which may increase availability of reduced glutathione. PGLG also decreases red cell endothelial adhesion in patients with SCD. Of note, additional analysis of the phase 3 trial demonstrated a 63% lower occurrence of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in PGLG-treated SCD patients compared to control, which has important relevance in the pandemic. A recent report of two computational screens of FDA-approved therapeutics, directed to protein and chemistry targets and to gene expression changes induced by SARS-CoV-2, predicts glutathione and GLN are highly likely to confer benefit in COVID-19 (Kim, J Translat Med, 2020).\n \n Methods:We therefore reviewed reports of multi-system effects of GLN in experimental respiratory distress animal models and in ICU and COVID-19 patients. We focused on contributors to cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the leading causes of mortality in COVID-19 (Huang, Lancet, 2020). We also conducted a clinical trial in hospitalized COVID-19 patients on ESPEN-recommended nutrition +/- GLN.\n \n Results:In experimental ARDS, sepsis, and endotoxin-induced lung injury, GLN decreases consolidation, pulmonary edema, and neutrophil infiltration and increases lung compliance, oxygen saturation, heat shock protein activation, and survival by 2.5-fold over saline controls (Perng WC, Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol, 2010; Singleton, Crit Care Med, 2005). Patients with severe COVID-19 have increased proinflammatory cytokines; interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels predict and contribute to severity of COVID-19 (Yuki, Clin Immunol, 2020). GLN modulates inflammatory responses by suppressing C-reactive protein, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 release; it also reduces IL-6 in murine studies (37% decrease,p< 0.05; Chuang, BMC Pulm Med, 2014), which could benefit COVID-19 patients.\n Myocardial injury occurs in up to 12% of COVID-19 patients directly with viral entry through ACE-2 receptors, microvascular damage, endothelial shedding, and inflammation-mediated damage, which GLN protects against (Shi, Eur Heart J, 2020; Shi, JAMA Cardiol, 2020; Shao, Pak J Med Sci, 2015). Inflammatory states lead to GLN consumption and negative GLN balance (Santos, Amino Acids, 2019). Deficient plasma GLN (< 420 \u00b5mol/L) is a defined risk for higher mortality in ICU and COVID-19 patients (Shen, Cell, 2020). Glutathione deficiency contributes to SARS-CoV-2 oxidative lung damage and severe disease (Polonikov, ACS Infect Dis, 2020).\n In a recent clinical trial, patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, had positive CT scans, and were admitted from a COVID-19 clinic. Both arms received ESPEN-recommended nutrition for COVID-19 alone or with GLN (10 grams, 3 times/day; see Table).\n \n Conclusions:GLN and glutathione deficiency contribute to COVID-19 severity, and GLN has salutary biologic actions on reducing lung pathology, mediators of cytokine storm, and myocardial injury in animal models, SCD, and ICU patients. GLN reduces severity in standard risk COVID-19 patientsafterinfection has occurred. These findings, combined with computational prediction of GLN benefit vs. COVID-19, support the hypothesis that PGLG treatmentprior toSARS-CoV-2 infection mayreducethe development of severe COVID-19 in SCD and perhaps other high-risk populations. The data as a whole provides a strong rationale for a controlled clinical trial of PGLG toreducesevere COVID-19 in high-risk SCD patients and improve outcomes if infection occurs.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Disclosures\n \n Cengiz:\n Biruni University Medical Faculty:Current Employment;Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty:Ended employment in the past 24 months.Yavuzer:\n Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Geriatrics:Current Employment.Yavuzer:\n Biruni University Medical Faculty:Current Employment;Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa Mediacl Faculty:Ended employment in the past 24 months.Tang:\n Kaiser Permanente:Current Employment.Ward:\n Emmaus Medical, Inc.:Current Employment.Goodrow:\n Emmaus Medical, Inc.:Current Employment;Emmaus Life Sciences Shareholder:Current equity holder in publicly-traded company.Ludlum:\n Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc.:Consultancy, Current equity holder in publicly-traded company.Stark:\n Emmaus Life Sciences Shareholder:Current equity holder in publicly-traded company;Emmaus Medical, Inc:Current Employment.Perrine:\n Cetya Inc.:Membership on an entity\u2019s Board of Directors or advisory committees;Phoenicia Bioscience:Current Employment, Current equity holder in private company, Membership on an entity\u2019s Board of Directors or advisory committees;Phoenicia Therapeutics:Membership on an entity\u2019s Board of Directors or advisory committees, Patents & Royalties;Boston University School of Medicine:Current Employment, Patents & Royalties;Viracta Therapeutics:Patents & Royalties.\n", "authors": ["M.

A superstar's absence has detrimental effects on the quality of games, especially with respect to the fan experience. This paper uses rigorous econometric methods to quantify the per-game value associated with the NBA\u2019s top players by evaluating ticket price changes on a secondary ticket marketplace when such players are announced to miss a game. We collect high temporal frequency microdata from an online secondary ticket marketplace and the exact timing of player absence announcements to determine the reduction in willingness-to-pay associated with a superstar absence for the average NBA game attendee. Our findings suggest that absences of several superstars, including some of the most popular like Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, and Anthony Davis, do have a statistically significant and economically meaningful impact ranging from a 7-25% ($9-$25) reduction in the average ticket price for matchups in which they are absent. Over a season, this can lead to millions of dollars in welfare losses. We conduct additional heterogeneity tests, and find that certain players, like Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, exhibit much larger away game absence effects, while others like Anthony Davis and Kristaps Porzingis experience much larger home game absence effects. Furthermore, the negative impact of a superstar absence is much smaller for games played in larger markets. Our findings have significant ramifications for the NBA and individual franchises, including NBA policies on resting players, the implications of suspensions for welfare of NBA fans, and franchise decision-making about dynamic pricing schemes in the primary marketplace. * Corresponding Author.

Understanding this concept is crucial not just for front office personnel, but the players and the coaches of the NBA. This research explored whether or not Moreyball accurately predicts success in the NBA. The methodology used multiple regressions between specific NBA statistics and the Win/Loss record of NBA teams. The results of this research showed that on its own, the main statistics of Moreyball were significant in predicting team success in the NBA. However when additional statistics were included, the strength of the model increases, demonstrating there is more than just the Moreyball variables that contribute to team success. MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 3 Moneyball to Moreyball: How Analytics Have Shaped the NBA Today The NBA is a league that has undergone many changing philosophies on both offense and defense. Over the decades there are many instances that show a change in how the game is played. Whether it is the installation of the three point line, or the introduction of the handcheck rule, the NBA has undergone many transformations since the league was formed in 1949 (Steca, Pala, Greco, Monzani, & D'Arrario, 2013). Defense in the NBA has shifted almost as much as offense in the NBA, and it is important to understand how these fads affect the league, and the success of the teams as well. The athletes in the NBA are stronger, quicker, and more athletic than their earlier counterparts (Mangine, Gonzalez, Jaijtner, Scanlon, Rogowski, & Stout, 2014). A transition from interior offenses to perimeter-based offensive game plans has caused a dramatic shift in the shot selection of players in the NBA, and as a result, new philosophical models have been created to benefit from this change. The concept of Moreyball has become the newest concept in the NBA, derived from this new-age, perimeter game, and the mastermind behind it is Daryl Morey, currently the Houston Rockets General Manager. His philosophy revolves around the idea that taking as many three point shots as possible, as well as many shots as possible close to the rim are the recipe for offensive success (Caporale & Collier, 2015). The defensive concept of Moreyball is centered on the idea of having a strong, interior defensive presence, and promoting the perimeter defenders to force their assignments to take mid-range jump-shots, statistically proven as the least efficient shot in basketball (Caporale & Collier, MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 4 2015). Doing so will reduce the chance of the opposing team taking three point shots or shots close to the rim. The core concepts of the literature, which are analytics, factors influencing individual success and factors influencing team success allow a foundation of knowledge to understand the many complexities of the NBA. The research method used will give the reader a concrete understanding of the data collected and analyzed, allowing observations that can be drawn and discussed. The intention of this research is to educate the reader and enhance their knowledge on the current state of analytics in the NBA, and the potential for growth of analytics as well. What this research looks to answer is: does Moreyball accurately predict the success of NBA teams? Literature Review The use of new, advanced analytics in the NBA has proven quite useful, however they are not the end-all when it comes measuring success. A myriad of factors influence success in the NBA, and they extend further than just emphasizing threes and dunks on offense, or tilting the defense towards whatever side the other team\u2019s best offensive players is standing (Bartholomew, & Collier, 2012). There are factors that influence the success of both the team and the individual. Understanding the factors that influence both individual and team success is important because doing so can assist teams in pinpointing where a problem may exist on the team. According to Aicinena (2013), a good coach has the ability to understand that there will be outside variables affecting his/her team. Also, a good coach will not lose themselves MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 5 emotionally because of those variables, however a good coach will not ignore the outside variables that exist (Leite, Coelho, & Sampaio, 2011). Understanding the multiple variables influencing individual and team success is critical, as well as their positive and negative interactions. Analytics The increased literature on analytics in the NBA has opened the door for more tools to be used in the evaluation of players and teams. Wallace, Caudill, & Mixon Jr. (2013) were able to provide evidence that disproves the notion that NBA players elevate their level of performance in the playoffs, specifically during the fourth quarter, which is referred to as \u201ccrunch time\u201d. Using the 2011 NBA playoffs as the source of data, Wallace et al. (2013) arrived to the conclusion that NBA players do not raise their performance levels in the fourth quarters of playoff games, but in fact their level of playing actually decreases in the fourth quarter compared to the first through third quarters of playoff games. Such a realization is compounded when you stop to consider some of the names that were measured in the 2011 playoffs: Tim Duncan, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Dirk Nowitzki to name a few. A common notion tied to these and several other superstars that participated in the 2011 playoffs is their ability to raise their performance levels in the fourth quarters of playoff games, however Wallace et al. (2013) were able to disprove this myth. Such a revelation will not change the opinion that diehard fans may have of these players, but when it comes to decision making by coaching staffs for and against these players, keeping this in mind can completely alter the game plan previously drawn up by the head coach. MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 6 This builds on the research conducted by Koehler and Conley (2003) regarding the debunking of the \u201chot hand\u201d myth. Using the annual Three Point Contest held in the NBA and coding that is designed to alert the observers when an announcer makes a reference to the state of the athlete, Koehler and Conley (2003) came to the conclusion that shooters made a high percentage of their shots before the announcement that \u201cX player is on fire!\u201d However, their shooting percentages drop dramatically after the proclamation of their present state (\u201chot\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d). Although this study is limited by the fact that it only observes the Three Point Contest, the contest itself was created for the NBA players that specialize in the three point shot to showcase themselves against others of the same mold, to compare who can stay hot the longest. Which is an interesting statement to say now that the whole idea has been disproven. An example of defensive metrics comes from Csapo and Raab (2014), in which they measure the effect of defensive pressure on players that are considered to be on a \u201chot/cold streak.\u201d Although the idea of the \u201chot/cold hand\u201d is considered to be a myth, Csapo and Raab simplify it to a player that connects on consecutive shots or misses on consecutive shots. Csapo and Raab (2014) conclude that as a player hits more shots, the shot difficulty increases as the defensive pressure increases, and that a player will then miss more shots because of the increased defensive pressure. Also, when Csapo and Raab (2014) take into consideration field goal percentage, the offensive player\u2019s performance is not increased during \u201chot streaks.\u201d Together, the research of Csapo and Raab (2014), Koehler and Conley (2003), and Wallace, Caudill, & MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 7 Mixon Jr. (2013), we see a shift in the reality of the NBA, from a league dominated by stars going on \u201chot streaks\u201d to a league that is educated as to why players seem to \u201craise their level of play.\u201d As a result, these pieces of literature can be used by coaches to preach to their teams to not lose focus when an opposing player strings together a few successful shots. A common occurrence in the NBA is when a superstar player is able to hit a few shots in a row, and on the following possession, the defender becomes too overzealous and overextends themselves, giving the offensive player an opportunity to bypass their primary defender and look for a high percentage shot, a theory reinforced by Koehler and Conley (2003). However, these examples of advanced analytics are leaving out an area that has become highly desirable for measurement: defensive metrics. In the NBA, Blocks and Steals were the only concrete pieces of statistical information that measures a player\u2019s defensive abilities. According to Franks, Miller, Bornn, & Goldsberry (2015, p.1), \u201cWhile steals, blocks, and rebounds do provide some useful proxies for defensive skills, they represent small discrete signals within the perpetual broadcast of defensive play.\u201d The work of Franks et al. (2015) resulted in five brand new defensive metrics: (1) Volume Score, which is the total magnitude of attempts a defender faces, (2) Disruption Score, defined as the degree to which an individual defender is able to reduce the effectiveness of his assignment\u2019s shots, (3) Defensive Shot Charts, similar to shot charts, but for a visual depiction of an individual\u2019s defensive prowess; both Volume Score and Disruption Score are mapped across the scoring area, (4) Shots Against, MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 8 described as a weighted average of the shots attempted against the defender per 100 possessions, and finally (5) Counterpoints, depicted as a weighted average of points scored against a particular defender per 100 possessions. When these new metrics are put to use by Franks et al. (2015), we can see a clear image of a specific defender. For example, Kwahi Leonard, a small forward for the San Antonio Spurs, is establishing a reputation as one of the top overall defenders i", "authors": ["Joseph Catalfano"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2015}, "6": {"title": "Modelling the NBA to Make Better Predictions ARCHpES", "abstract": "Unexpected events often occur in the world of sports.

According to Forbes, the Warriors have gone from NBA obscurity to the third most valuable team in the NBA. The objective of this research is to prove the importance of both physical prowess and business savvy in the sports world to become truly successful as a professional franchise. As the NBA has evolved, the Warriors serve as an ideal case study for hyper-commercialized professional sports. This can be seen through branding tied to their on-court performance, financial ownership strategies, and international market growth, especially in China. Successful branding strategies have allowed the Warriors to corner the retail market with their merchandise (Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant have the #1 and #3 most popular NBA jerseys) and the Warriors also lead the league in team merchandise sales. The Warriors\u2019 skillful financial stewardship has separated itself from other NBA ownership through the creation of the Bridge Club, the use of Silicon Valley precepts, and the cultivation of relationships with both majority and minority shareholders\u2014some tactics that are now being copied elsewhere.

The union was formed as a result of the reaction of countries of the former Communist Bloc to the dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance that created economic and security problems for the states, which they tried to solve partially by the enforcement of regional cooperation.\nAccording to the instruments of incorporation, the V4 Group is headed by one of the state members based on annual rotation, with a Summit of Heads of Governments held at the end. The countries head the organization for one year by turn.\nThe main priorities of heading include expansion of the EU to the Western Balkans and eastern policy of the EU, cooperation in the field of defence, etc.\nUkraine is one of the key partners of the V4 Group, aiming primarily at establishing a comprehensive dialogue and elaborating a joint position on the whole range of topical issues of international partnership and political situation, including in the region of the East Central Europe.\nIn the period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020, the V4 Group was headed by the Czech Republic. Taking into consideration significant changes in the security environment, the program of Czech heading was targeted at the expansion of cooperation in the following areas:\n\u2013\u00a0internal unity (joint political approach and solutions: there were more than 10 statements approved by the V4 Group at the level of Heads of Governments and Ministers of Foreign Affairs since the escalation of the situation in Ukraine regarding the support of Ukraine and preservation of its territorial integrity);\n\u2013\u00a0defence and security cooperation (implementation of common projects both within the V4 Group and the European Union), and others.\nPolish heading provided for coordination of the position of the state members of the V4 Group concerning Ukraine and the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, and evaluation of the previous activities of the V4 Group towards the support of Ukraine. The Republic of Poland makes every effort to strengthen relations with Ukraine aimed at minimizing political threats and enforcing Polish defence.\nIn the area of military cooperation, Ukraine and the Republic of Poland achieved substantial success in formation of the regulatory and legal framework of cooperation and initiation of primary directions of collaboration \u2013 from participation in the Partnership for Peace Program, joint military trainings, sharing experiences, improvement of professional skills of officers, education of mobile and tank forces to formation of a Polish-Ukrainian unit.\nSupport of the idea of creation of a common security (defence) space from the Baltic States to the Back Sea must become a prioritized direction in cooperation between Ukraine and the Visegrad Group. Intensification of mutual efforts in the mentioned area will contribute to restraining the unhidden full-scale military aggression of Russia and serve as a factor of holding the Russian Federation from new re-division of the spheres of influence and territories.\nConclusions of the research and prospects for further studies. Therefore, Ukraine has a great potential for the expansion of cooperation with the countries of the V4 Group in the military field, in particular with Poland and Czech Republic. Planning of and participation in the activities within the regional military collaboration of the Visegrad Group with Ukraine gradually turn into an efficient ground for the achievement of the main strategic objective of our country \u2013 full integration into the European Atlantic security space and joining the political and military alliance NATO.\nFurther studies will provide an insight into the possibilities for enhancement of cooperation of Ukraine with the individual state members of the Visegrad Group (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia) in the military field and development of comprehensive measures to mitigate the destructive policy of Hungary towards Ukraine.", "authors": ["L.

The authors implement a research approach based on the fact that conflictology is a branch of knowledge at the intersection of different sciences and that it operates with methods and developments not only of philosophy, psychology, and sociology but also, above all, of law, especially in terms of methods of conflict prevention and resolution. Despite the fact that this science is now becoming more and more autonomous, we should not forget that it was formed at the junction of many disciplines, both applied, theoretical and theoretical and applied, and the study of its basic concepts, their essence, as well as preventive mechanisms, ways of levelling, and conflict resolution is impossible in full without recourse to legal mechanisms, methods, and means. The sphere of corporate law is the most striking example of the formation, use, and improvement of these legal instruments. This chapter reveals the essence of corporate conflict in the system of public relations, law, and legislation of the Russian Federation. \n \nTo achieve this goal, the authors define the concept of the corporation as the main tasks, as well as the nature and signs of corporate conflict. The approaches of corporate practice, doctrine, and judicial and legislative acts to the studied definition of \u201ccorporate conflicts\u201d and related or identical concepts of \u201ccorporate disputes,\u201d \u201cinternal conflict,\u201d and \u201cconflict of interest\u201d are investigated and compared. \n \nIt is noted that the needs of the economy, society, and law require clarification and development of a clear conceptual apparatus, and that its divergence is a common problem concerning the legal regulation of all areas of public life without exception. \n \nThe problems associated with the defects of the legal definition of the corporation and the lack of a unified view on it in the doctrine are analyzed, which, according to the authors, is one of the negative factors affecting the emergence of conflicts. The author investigates the poorly studied and ambiguously perceived by the doctrine characteristic of corporate relations, among which can be attributed to the corporate conflict. Another problem identified by the authors is the character of the conflict itself and the specifics of the corporate conflict. \n \nThe legal characteristic of the term \u201cconflict\u201d and \u201ccorporate conflict\u201d from the position of private law is given. The signs of conflict as a legal category in corporate law are identified and listed. \n \nIn conclusion, as a solution to the main problem, the need for a clear distinction between internal and external relations of the corporation and their relationship with the failed legal definition of corporate relations in the civil code is pointed out. \n \nRecommendations for the improvement of legal regulation are developed. In order to unify the concept of \u201cCorporation\u201d and bring the Russian legal definition in the civil code in line with international and foreign approaches, it is proposed to include in the characteristics of the corporation property criterion \u2013 the formation of the original property base. The necessity and ways of exclusion of non-profit organizations from the number of corporations are substantiated. \n \nThe features of corporate conflict as a kind of legal and social conflicts are listed. \n \nMaterials \nThe basis of the analysis carried out in this part of the work was the normative and advisory sources included in the system of Russian law in the sphere of corporate conflicts regulation. \n \nFor the purpose of a comprehensive study of the existing norms and the definition of promising trends in their development, the provisions of policy acts of a strategic nature, such as the concept of development of the legislation of the Russian Federation for the period 2008\u20132011 and the concept of 2016 to improve the legislation of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2021 were studied. \n \nThe study examined the provisions of industry-specific codified acts of both regulatory and advisory nature, such as the civil code of the Russian Federation, the code of corporate conduct (now invalid), and the code of corporate governance, approved by the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Russia from April 10, 2014. \n \nAmong the special Federal laws that form the basis of positive legal regulation of corporate conflicts are: Federal law No. 205-FL \u201cOn amendments to certain legislative acts of the Russian Federation\u201d; Federal law No. 82-FL of May 19, 1995, \u201con public associations\u201d; Federal law No. 193-FL of December 8, 1995, \u201con agricultural cooperation\u201d; Federal law No. 7-FL of January 12, 1996, \u201con non-profit associations\u201d; Federal law No. 79-FL of July 27, 2004, \u201con the state civil service of the Russian Federation\u201d; Federal law No. 7-FL \u201con non-profit associations\u201d of December 25, 2008, g. 273-FL \u201con combating corruption\u201d; the Federal law of March 2, 2007 No. 25-FL \u201con municipal service in the Russian Federation.\u201d \n \nIn the course of the study, the authors actively formed an empirical base and turned to judicial and arbitration practice, which were: the Decision of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation of July 18, 2003, No.14-P \u201cin the case of verification of the constitutionality of the provisions of Article 35 of the Federal law \u201con joint stock companies,\u201d Articles 61 and 99 of the civil code of the Russian Federation, Article 31 of the tax code of the Russian Federation, and Article 14 of the Arbitration procedural code of the Russian Federation; the Decision of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation of March 15, 2005.

Coser, J. Von Neumann, N. Morgenstern, V. Yadov, T. V. Novikova, etc. \n \nStudying corporate conflicts in legal doctrine, the authors turned to the works of D. I. Dedov and A. A. Kirillov. \n \nThe theory of interest and \u201clegally protected interests\u201d were studied thanks to the works of Rudolf von Ihering, who as the main idea behind the development of mechanisms for their balance. In the Russian doctrine, the issues of subjective and legitimate interests were developed in the works of Y. S. Gambarov, V. P. Gribanov, N. M. Korkunova, and G. F.

This translates into many hours of manual work to export the kinematics. The proposed new tracking method tackles the above problems and reduces the time to export kinematics from several hours to less than 3 minutes. METHODS: Ten subjects (Males, age: 32\u00b14 years) with ACL reconstructed knee and healthy contra-lateral knee were selected from an ongoing study of ACL reconstruction (approved by our institutional IRB). After obtaining informed consent, 1.6mm tantalum markers were implanted in the distal femurs and proximal tibia of each joint (3 per bone) at the time of ACL reconstruction surgery. In-vivo 3D knee kinematics was acquired 3 years after ACL reconstruction during onelegged forward hopping (sub-maximal, hop distance 50% of lower limb length) using a new high-speed (both at 250 and 480 frames/s) and highresolution (with both 576x576 and 1152x1152 pixel) dynamic radiography instrumentation (DRSA) [1](Fig. 1). Performance of the Biplane Radiographic system was assessed using a customized calibration object (cube). Static precision (a function of system noise) was assessed with the test object positioned stationary in the center of the field of view. Dynamic errors were assessed by suspending the cube from a stiff elastic band and then dropping them (increased rotational motion), allowing them to twist and bounce throughout the field of view. A range of tests was performed using different combinations of acquisition rates, resolution, exposure i.e. 125-1000 images acquired at 250-400 frames/s with exposure (shutter) times ranging from 500-3000 \u03bcs. X-ray system protocols ranged from 40 to 90 kVp, 40 to 120 mA, 1 s with low (576x576) and high resolution (1152x1152) trials. In the trials with the patients 3D coordinates of implanted markers were determined for single-legged hoping trials using the DRSA method. RESULTS: The effect of resolution, brightness and exposure is shown in Fig. 2a,b for the high resolution experiment. It should be noted here that not only does kVp control the contrast of the X-ray, it also affects the density in two ways. As kVp is the energy of the stream of electrons, if increased it results in a higher part penetration. Increasing kVp also causes more radiation to be produced, which includes scattered radiation, which increases the density (\"blackness\") on the image. It seems that in most cases that there is an optimum in the exposure (kVp) and brightness (mA) combination. Increasing the exposure up to a certain point optimizes the gray level signature for the markers in the cubes moving at high speed in the calibration space. To distinguish between the two cameras we call them \u201cred\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d. The \u201cgreen\u201d camera is the camera with enhanced sensitivity and its lens can reach aperture of one (1). The lens on the \u201cred\u201d camera is set so that it cannot produce better aperture than 2 for comparison. It was obvious that increasing kVp and mA results in increase of gray level value for the low-resolution images. With the green camera there is almost a fourfold increase in the gray signature value when exposure increases from 40kVp to 90kVp. Only a two fold increase is observed for the same experiment in the \u201cred\u201d camera. We observed that at the high-resolution experiments, increasing the data acquisition rate reduces the displacement of the marker in the x, y-coordinates from frame to frame to less than 13 pixels (as compared to 30 in low resolution) making the tracking more efficient. However further improvements in the tracking algorithm in terms of the effectiveness by the \u201cLaplacian mask\u201d to enhance the contrast and identify occlusion areas is currently under way. The average marker area was apparently greater in the high-resolution tests in all human trials (Fig. 3). DISCUSSION: The DRSA method was tested with moving objects and in-vivo with embedded bone markers on patients moving at very high speeds. It was demonstrated that accuracy in tracking skeletal kinematics is much higher than conventional motion analysis techniques (one order of magnitude) and it can be performed at much lower exposure, almost at the level of fluoroscopy without data loss from blurring effects due to motion. Dynamic errors were greatly reduced with increasing image resolution. The interplay between brightness, contrast, exposure and resolution for the 1.6 mm tantalum bone markers was characterized for the new DRSA system with a variety of protocols.

The anatomy of the nail bed, capsular structures, and bony changes were described. Results.Marked nail bed thickening and contrast enhancement was noted in all clubbed fingers, with bone edema in 3 of the 4 patients. None of the healthy subjects had similar abnormalities. Conclusion. This confirms that hypervascularization of the nail bed observed in the microanatomy on high-resolution MRI is associated with clubbed appearances of the nails.

High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to study small joint arthritis involving the hands2,3,4. The importance of peripheral hypervascularization in finger clubbing is widely recognized5. Our small pilot study used high-resolution MRI to compare patients with finger clubbing against healthy subjects to gain better insights into the microanatomic basis for finger clubbing. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study subjects. Eight subjects participated in the study: 4 with finger clubbing (2 males, 2 females; mean age 43 yrs, range: 23\u201363 yrs) and 4 healthy volunteers (2 males, 2 females; mean age 38 yrs, range: 32\u201347 yrs). The study was approved by the local ethics committee and all subjects gave their informed consent. Patients with finger clubbing (clinically bulbous enlargement of the terminal phalanx, increased fluctuation of the nail bed, and loss of the angle between the nail and the basal tissues) were referred from the respiratory clinics (n = 2 with cystic fibrosis, n = 2 with fibrosing alveolitis; mean disease duration 9 yrs). The healthy volunteers were members of staff from the rheumatology department who responded to posters about the study, with no nail disease or illness. The groups were not matched by age or sex. High-resolution MRI. The finger that appeared most clubbed in each patient and the index finger of the dominant hand of the healthy volunteers were selected for imaging. One finger of each subject was imaged by high-resolution MRI using a 1.5T Gyroscan ACS-NT scanner (Philips Medical Systems). Subjects were placed in the prone position with the hand extended in front of the body. A 23-mm diameter microscopy MRI surface coil was placed on a distal interphalangeal joint including the nail, as described2. The protocol included T1-weighted sagittal and axial spin-echo, T2-weighted fat-suppressed spin-echo, coronal proton density-weighted 2-dimensional (2-D) spin-echo, 3-D gradient-echo sagittal images acquired using a water-selective radiofrequency excitation pulse, and axial and sagittal T1-weighted fat-suppressed spin-echo images after intravenous injection of 10 ml of the contrast agent gadolinium diethylene-triaminepenFinger clubbing is recognized as the oldest clinical sign in medicine1. The presence of finger clubbing is associated with a variety of diseases, including respiratory disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease, and malignant disease.

The imaging sequences were as published2. The measured slices were 1 mm thick, and therefore the acquired in-plane pixel dimension was between 160\u2013200 mm, with a displayed pixel dimension of 80\u2013100 mm. Analysis of MR images. MR images were analyzed using a commercially available image analysis software package Analyze (Mayo Clinic, BIR). The observers were blinded to the clinical status of the study subjects. The following structures were evaluated by consensus by a radiologist (EF) and a rheumatologist (JN): nail bed, nail root, collateral ligaments, extensor tendons, bone edema, erosions, and enthesophytes, as described3. The nail bed was defined as soft tissue between the nail plate and the distal phalanx, and nail root was defined as the base or origin of the nail underneath the skin. The results were recorded in a dichotomous manner (present/absent). The profile angle6, phalangeal depth ratio7, and thickness of nail bed were measured using the line profile tool in Analyze by a rheumatologist (JN) and a musculoskeletal research assistant (NAH) by consensus about the site of measurement (Figure 1A). Profile angle (ABC) was constructed by a line AB drawn from the distal digital skin crease to the cuticle and a line BC from the cuticle through a point C of contact with the nail bed. Phalangeal depth ratio (DPD/IPD ratio) was calculated by measuring the distal interphalangeal depth (IPD) at the distal digital skin crease and the distal phalangeal depth (DPD) at the proximal regions of the nail plate just before the cuticle disappears. The thickness of nail bed measured at the point where the nail meets the skin forms part of the DPD. Statistical analysis. Because ours was a descriptive pilot study with a small sample size, the results of significance tests are presented as a guideline only. Results are presented as medians and ranges, and pairwise analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney test. No correction for multiple testing was performed. No intraobserver or interobserver reliabilities were performed because the scoring was agreed by consensus between 2 readers for each component. RESULTS The fingers scanned in the clubbed cohort included 2 right index, 1 right middle, and 1 left index fingers. The patients with finger clubbing did not have any history of joint pain, and therefore, did not have hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. The healthy volunteers included 3 right index and 1 left index fingers. Measurements of finger clubbing. The measurements were obtained from the MR images. The profile angle, phalangeal depth ratio, and thickness of nail bed were greater in patients with finger clubbing than in healthy subjects. The median profile angle was 186\u00b0 (range: 179\u2013188\u00b0) in finger clubbing and 176\u00b0 (range: 154\u2013179\u00b0) in healthy subjects (p = 0.029). 524 The Journal of Rheumatology 2014; 41:3; doi:10.3899/jrheum.130823 Personal non-commercial use only.

For Australia, 2018 will be significant too, as the country takes its first ever seat at the United Nations Human Rights Council for a three-year term. Australia\u2019s ascent to the Council comes at a critical time; a time at which the work of human rights defenders globally has perhaps never been more important nor more imperilled. As civil society space closes at the national level, and defenders are criminalised, imprisoned and even killed \u2013 from China to Egypt, from Russia to Venezuela, and from Burundi to the Philippines \u2013 more and more defenders are seeking to use the international system to expose violations, to push for accountability, to obtain justice and protection, and as a lever for change. International civil society has high expectations of Australia as a Council member. We are a country with an overall strong record in building the UN human rights system and a rules-based international order, notwithstanding obvious gross departures when it comes to the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers and of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons and communities. Looking back at the end of Australia\u2019s term in 2021, these expectations will likely be met if Australia\u2019s time on the Council is characterised by three key elements. First, Australia should consult closely with civil society \u2013 both at the national and international levels \u2013 in developing its policies and positions at the Council. Independent civil society can provide vital information and advice about the human rights situation on the ground and how best to address human rights challenges and violations. With human rights defenders around the world facing what the UN Special Rapporteur has described as \u2018unprecedented attack\u2019, Australia should also prioritise protecting defenders and promoting a safe and enabling environment for their work at the national, regional and international levels. Second, in seeking election to the Council, Australia pledged to focus on upholding freedom of expression, strengthening governance and democratic institutions, advancing women\u2019s rights, and protecting indigenous rights, among other things. Australia should operationalise this pledge by leading and supporting country-specific initiatives at the Council where these values and groups are under attack. This means leading or supporting statements or resolutions where freedom of expression is criminalised, such as in Burundi or Bahrain, where democracy and the rule of law are systematically subverted, such as in China or Venezuela, where women human rights defenders are attacked and abused, such as in Egypt or Saudi Arabia, or where peoples are driven from their lands, such as in Myanmar or Honduras. Like-minded States have shown what is possible through principled leadership. At the Council\u2019s 35th session in June 2017, Iceland led a joint statement on extrajudicial killings in the Philippines, while at the Council\u2019s 36th session in September the Netherlands spearheaded a resolution to establish an international investigation into war crimes in Yemen. Australia, by contrast, has a mixed-record at best when it comes to addressing country situations \u2013 soft pedalling on accountability for gross human rights violations in countries such as Sri Lanka and Cambodia where Australia\u2019s refugee and asylum seeker policy had a craven distorting effect on foreign policy.

I situate this song within larger memorial culture, Civil War memory, and musical memorials to show how it commemorates and criticizes official narratives of the Civil War. While the first three verses present an earnest version of the song that celebrates military power, the fourth quotes Mahler to transform the song into an ironic funeral march. I draw on scholarship on the musical grotesque to show how this grotesque funeral march critiques conventional perceptions of the Civil War, and how Crumb extends this critique to more recent American wars. DOI: 10.30535/mto.27.2.0 Volume 27, Number 2, June 2021 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Society for Music Theory [1.1] On June 10, 2011, soprano Dawn Upshaw performed a newly imagined version of George Crumb\u2019s Winds of Destiny: A Cycle of Civil War Songs, Folk Songs, and Spirituals (2004) at the Ojai Music Festival. Retaining the original scoring for soprano, piano, and percussion, Upshaw and director Peter Sellars transformed the Civil War cycle into a commentary on twenty-first-century war. She wore fatigues and the stage se ing included a bed in order to portray a veteran of the American war in Afghanistan. In the show, the soldier experiences an episode of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) while trying to fall asleep. During the second song, \u201cWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home Again,\u201d she springs to a ention at the sound of the military drums and acts out what one critic called a \u201cmini-drama\u201d of the song\u2019s narrative (Swed 2011). Her tone shifts from celebratory to funereal by the end of the song, adding what Crumb called \u201can ironic twist\u201d to its typical patriotic message (Wein 2011).(1) [1.2] Upshaw\u2019s contemporary staging illustrates how Crumb\u2019s se ing of \u201cWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home Again\u201d acutely addresses both historical and contemporary concerns about the carnage of war and its emotional and psychological consequences. The initial three verses of the piece feature traditional images and sounds of Civil War narratives: imitations of military parade sounds, snare drum topoi, and an earnest presentation of the original song\u2019s melody and lyrics. In this way, the piece seems to conform to conventional Civil War myth and memory that focus on heroic acts in a just war to end the nation\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d of slavery. In the last verse, however, the tone changes to one of sarcasm. Crumb quotes a funeral march from Mahler to invoke the musical grotesque and uses other semiotic techniques to signal that the ultimate meaning of the song is not an expression of heroic triumph but instead a public display of mourning and regret (Edwards 2017; Evere 2009; Meindl 1996; Sheinberg 2000).(2) [1.3] Crumb\u2019s ironic se ing of \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d changes its original meaning and suggests that traditional collective memory of the Civil War no longer holds. Through his se ing, Crumb both memorializes and criticizes the Civil War. In his critical se ing, the Civil War serves as a metonym for the legacy of American wars in a broad sense. As a material remembrance of the Civil War that \u201cclaims a particular historical narrative\u201d (Doss 2010, 9), I argue that Winds of Destiny and specifically \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d function as artifacts of Civil War memory and broader American collective memory of wars in general. I situate this individual song in the context of American memorialization and monument culture, including Civil War monuments and material tributes to more recent conflicts. Following Erika Doss, I show how this piece can be understood as a material manifestation of public memory while also contesting certain elements of American war remembrance. Though musical memorials differ from statues, Crumb\u2019s piece nevertheless manifests images of collective public memory of the Civil War through its sonic material and conveys the same types of narrative content Doss identifies in monuments around the country. [1.4] In discussing the piece\u2019s initial celebratory verses, I adapt J. Martin Daughtry\u2019s concept of belliphonic sounds, or sounds that encompass the sonic experience and violence of war (Daughtry 2015, 161). For Daughtry, the belliphonic encompasses all sounds of war, including propagandistic messages that frequently accompany it and occur when celebrating it. While many of Daughtry\u2019s examples of the belliphonic focus on weapons, electricity generators, or vehicle sounds, he recognizes musical expressions as well, such as the Muslim adhan that features prominently in Iraq\u2019s belliphonic soundscape. In this case, I expand the belliphonic to apply to post-war celebration, in particular how it may be used to justify previous and future acts of war. Aesthetic responses to war form an indirect but integral part of the belliphonic. Various se ings of \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d serve utilitarian, patriotic, and legitimizing purposes. In the Civil War, men could sing the song to provide a consistent marching tempo as army units moved. In victory celebrations, the song is sung or played to convey a sense of military power and accompanying notions of justice used to rationalize wartime actions. Crumb\u2019s first three verses employ the song to evoke such commemorations, tacitly invoking the belliphonic music of the Civil War. Commemorative music like Crumb\u2019s act as \u201cdiscursive structures\u201d that Daughtry cites as enabling violent acts of war (Daughtry 2015, 11). In Crumb\u2019s se ing, the initial verses display a more conventionally optimistic response to war, celebrating soldiers and their sacrifices. However, Crumb\u2019s fourth verse distorts any a empt to stir up patriotic sentiment by replacing notions of martial justice with expressions of mourning. Daughtry poses the question: \u201cWhat kinds of victims, what kinds of survivors, do belliphonic sounds create?\u201d (Daughtry 2015, 5). The fourth verse provides an answer. In this case, it creates mourners whose grief distorts patriotic expressions of the belliphonic. Crumb\u2019s \u201cWhen Johnny,\u201d brought to life in part by its celebratory drums and whistling, is a sonic remembrance of all those who died in the Civil War. [1.5] In the following sections, I analyze the semiotics of Crumb\u2019s victorious military parade sounds in the initial verses. Crumb portrays the glory of war, as demonstrated in such a parade, through unpredictable, loud, fast, and unevenly timed sounds. Marching cadences and snare drums suggest military drill formations or parade marching; weapon sounds suggest the ceremonial firing of guns and cannons, though the ba le has ceased. The piece\u2019s timbres, pitch organization, and rhythms create an affect that displays military might and glorifies the army\u2019s power in ways that support traditional notions of heroism, militarism, and masculinity (Doss 2010, 24). These verses connect images of martial strength with the triumphant lyrics that reference a peaceful, merry time when Johnny and the other soldiers return from war. Ultimately, I next show how the grotesque affect of the final verse, which depicts a funeral procession for \u201cJohnny,\u201d mocks both the Civil War era\u2019s cultural values as well as expressions of more recent American patriotism. Third, I discuss how Crumb\u2019s quotation of Mahler prompts reflection on who is commemorated through this march, and who accompanies \u201cJohnny\u201d to the grave. [1.6] In a manner analogous to visual memorials, this song relies on musical affect, or expressed emotions or feelings, to convey a point of view on American war culture (Doss 2010, 15). I use \u201caffect\u201d because memorials and monuments aim to produce certain emotional responses in their visitors, and musical memorials function likewise.(3) Musical affect may be conveyed by cues such as quotations, schemata, and tropes. Hearing the work allude to a celebratory military march that conveys parade sounds and displays power can elicit a specific range of emotional response from listeners, as can hearing its contrasting affect in the fourth verse. That abrupt shift implies that the heroism, masculinity, and militarism of the initial sections are artifices fabricated to justify the death and destruction of war. Memorials effectively reconstruct the past in light of contemporary social need. As such, Crumb\u2019s piece responds to his need to re-examine American militarism (Doss 2010, 46). Just as monuments strongly convey aspects of how Americans view themselves today, in Crumb\u2019s commentary, the Civil War stands in for the idea of violent military conflict in general (Doss 2010, 15). This theme is consistent with social criticisms of recent American wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, helping to illuminate why Upshaw was compelled to perform Crumb\u2019s piece in this manner. [1.7] It is important to remember that \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d functioned as a musical memorial long before Crumb\u2019s se ing. The song was wri en in 1863 by Patrick S. Gilmore (1829\u20131892), a wellknown Irish bandleader in the Union army, and has been steadily popular since then.(4) The tune of \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d appears prominently in Morton Gould\u2019s American Salute (1942), which is often performed by military bands such as The President\u2019s Own and by high school bands across the country. It is also regularly performed by the Navy Band and the Air Force Band at ceremonies, memorials, and commemorations. \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d also appears with other patriotic tunes in the Civil War Fantasy (1961) by Jerry Bilik, a frequently played symphonic band piece. Doss (2010, 25) writes that physical memorials, especially statues, have served to champion \u201ccollective national ideas, as did a widespread public culture of national anthems, holidays, festivals, and fairs.\u201d Arrangements of \u201cWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home Again\u201d are well suited musical accompaniments to such events because the song traditionally expresses enthusiasm for patriotic narratives of men\u2019s heroic deeds and successful return from war.

In selecting for this anthology articles, broadcasts and book extracts that have got behind the facade of official silence to reveal important and disturbing truths, John Pilger is paying his own professional tribute to some of the men and women he most admires. Here are the famous muckrakers (Seymour Hersh on the My Lai massacre), as well as the less well known (Wilfred Burchett, the first Westerner to enter Hiroshima in September 1945; Israeli journalist Amira Hass, reporting from the Gaza Strip in the 1990s). Here, too, are the mavericks (the great German undercover reporter Gunter Wallraff; Jessica Mitford on 'The American Way of Death'). The book ranges from across many of the critical events, scandals and struggles of the past fifty years, from the scenes witnessed at the liberation of the death camp at Dachau in 1945, to the bloodshed caused by the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Along the way it bears witness to epic injustices committed against the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, East Timor and Palestine. John Pilger sets each piece of reporting in its context, often offering personal insights into the writer, and introduces the collection with a passionate essay arguing that the kind of journalism he celebrates here is being subverted by the very forces that ought to be its enemy.

[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Birthday celebrations Carl Linnaeus just turned a venerable 300! Most students know only about his penchant for creating Latin names for some 7,700 plants and 4,400 animals. However, his contribution to science goes beyond that. Stephen Jay Gould's famous essay, Linnaeus's Luck? (2000), suggested that Linnaeus had a far greater understanding of evolution than he admitted to his peers, almost 100 years before Lamarck and Darwin offered their models. Linnaeus (Blunt and Stearn 2002) is a fascinating and rounded portrait of Linnaeus, charting his rise from a poor student at Lund University to Professor of Medicine at Uppsala and a founder of the Royal Academy of Sciences. Linnaeus is a beautiful book from a talented biological illustrater, which provides many details of both life and biology. The year 2009 will mark Charles Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species (1859). You could prepare by watching the finches in your backyard, or further, grab a good book about Darwin. Reviewer Debbie Chessin suggests that everyone should reread The Voyage of the Beagle (Darwin 1909). In a proposed trilogy on Darwin's life, Charles Darwin: The Power of Place (2002), author Janet Browne begins in 1858, providing details of Darwin's far-ranging interests and the politics surrounding the publication of his works. Reviewer Cary Seidman says: \"Reviewing the lively, intellectual discussion of Darwin's revolutionary ideas, which occurred over 100 years ago will encourage responsible and caring science teachers to continue framing their teaching around one of history's most powerful and far-reaching ideas.\" Eloise Farmer recommends author Jonathan Weiner, who has not only written The Beak of the Finch (1995), but also Time, Love, Memory: A Great Biologist and His Quest for the Origins of Behavior (1999) about Seymour Benzer, an unsung pioneer of molecular biology. For a content update, reviewer Charles Jervis recommends The Plausibility of Life: Resolving Darwin's Dilemma by Marc W. Kirschner and John C. Gerhart (2005) for those who want more details and an integration of modern biological techniques. Jervis says: \"Bringing together ideas as diverse as the origins of deer antlers, shifts in hemoglobin oxygen affinity, neural crest fate in embryological development, the Cambrian Explosion, and operon gene regulation, the authors paint a convincing picture.\" If you want to spend your vacation preparing to help students celebrate evolutionary science, reviewer David Brock suggests you grab Evolution 101 by Randy Moore and Janice Moore (2006). \"Seldom is a book so well written and well researched that it ought to be required reading for every thinking person,\" Brock says.

By Sandra Moats. (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2010. Pp. 255. Cloth, $36.00.)Reviewed by Ronald J. Zboray and Mary Saracino ZborayDuring the past two decades, scholarship on the vital roles that public celebrations, memorials, and rituals have played during the early American republic has broadened our understanding of the inextricable intersections between government, the body politic, and cultural life. Studies by Simon P. Newman, Sarah J. Purcell, Len Travers, and David Waldstreicher have explored the ways politicos and common people alike constructed political cultures, civic memory, and, indeed, nationalism itself, out of, for example, George Washington's birthday fetes, Bunker Hill commemorations, and Independence Day processions. These historians have also located meaning-making contests among varied groups within public festivity, from partisan politicos jockeying for power to disfranchised women and free African Americans struggling to achieve a sense of agency. In this study, an expansion of her 2001 dissertation about President Monroe's 1817-1819 national tours, Sandra Moats brings to this ongoing conversation a focus on the positions that the first five presidents - particularly George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Monroe - assumed within this world of political spectacle.1Celebrating the Republic \"tells the story,\" according to Moats, \"of how our first presidents invented the American political culture that endures today by employing the symbols and rituals they believed best illustrated republican principles to an American citizenry who now possessed sovereign authority over this new national government\" (3). The fivechapter-long story reconstructed from published presidents' papers, congressional documents, and newspapers, is based upon the premise that popular sovereignty was not a \" 'fiction,' \" and that this \"governing principle had to be activated for the new government to succeed\" (6). The first two chapters are devoted to Washington, who, beginning with his pre-inaugural procession that approximated a \"royal progress\" through triumphal arches, appropriated monarchial traditions for republican ends - to reach the sovereign citizenry. His 1789-1791 national tours, graced by receptions, toasting, and speechifying, as well as his open houses, levees, and dinner parties at the capital, provided accessibility, but smacked of aristocratic pretension according to critics. Republicans pounced - none more relentlessly and covertly than Thomas Jefferson, according to Moats - on regal presidential ceremony, even as John Adams was strategically lowering its register during his administration. Assaults upon Federalist-fashioned pomp hardened under Jefferson - the subject of chapter 3 - who \"adopted an intentionally unadorned public style\" (83) that at times made his official hostess, Dolley Madison, flinch. Jefferson's dismantling of formality, however, \"introduced a new generation of voters to a new way of honoring republicanism\" (88). While James and Dolley Madison brought back some of the bygone elegance, it was James Monroe who revived Washington's ceremonial tours - albeit without some of their fussiness and on a larger, more regionally denned stage that lent distinct local flavor to the proceedings. Chapters 4 and 5 show that although Monroe's nonpartisan tours were meant to celebrate national unity, they invited last-gasp Federalist rallying in the Northeast, unleashed election-minded Republican horntooting in the South and West, and engendered newspaper attacks all around. Moats concludes that the architects of the Second Party System refashioned political ceremony in more democratic ways, but with the same end in mind as their predecessors, namely \"putting sovereign citizens in contact with their government\" (171). \u2026", "authors": ["Ronald J.

The previous day, we had held a celebration of his recent 95th birthday at EPRI, with Chauncey holding forth on his life experiences and lessons learned. He was in fine fettle. The following morning, before leaving for his office at EPRI, as he had been doing ever since his official retirement 30 years previously, he took his usual short nap after breakfast. But this time, he didn\u2019t wake up. It is hard to conceive of a more graceful way to end a long and fulfilling career. Starr was born in Newark, New Jersey, the second son of Jewish\u2013Russian immigrants. Educated in the local public-school system, he went on to earn degrees in engineering and physics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York. His 1935 PhD thesis examined the thermal and electrical properties of rectifying copper-oxide junctions. I used to kid him that if he had accidentally introduced some calcium impurities into his samples, he might have discovered today\u2019s family of hightemperature cuprate superconductors. He then joined Percy Bridgman\u2019s group at Harvard University to work on the thermal transport properties of metals at high pressure. This is one of the most difficult of condensed-matter experiments to carry out, given the confounding background of containment vessel and thermometry. Starr, however, devised a differential method that could much more accurately determine the thermal diffusivity (thermal conductivity and specific heat) of metals in such a situation. This was an especially notable advance at the time: Bridgman had published work suggesting that the Wiedemann\u2013Franz law, which links the thermal and electrical conductivities of metals, and was one of the lynchpins of the then emerging quantum theory of solids, may not apply to metals under pressure. With his new technique, Starr was able to show that this conclusion resulted from systematic errors in Bridgman\u2019s previous experiments. To claim that he saved Bridgman from not receiving his future Nobel prize may be a stretch, but he certainly rescued his boss from major embarrassment. Twenty-five years later, in 1962, I undertook my doctoral work in that same group at Harvard. At that time, several of my fellow students were still using the methods Starr had pioneered. From Harvard, Starr went on to a postgraduate position in the Magnet Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he added cryogenics and magnetic measurements to his portfolio of experimental skills. In 1940, he took a post with the US Navy\u2019s Bureau of Mines, leading a group of engineers analysing pressurewave propagation from mine explosions and exploring the effects of these waves on various hull geometries. Immediately after Pearl Harbor, he and a colleague tried to enlist in the army, but were told that what they were doing would be a greater contribution to the war effort than fighting in foxholes. Word of Starr\u2019s technical and leadership skills spread throughout the then small community of American physicists, and in 1942 he was invited to join the staff of E. O. Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley. Lawrence\u2019s intention (largely unknown to Starr at the time) was to train him in the principles of cyclotron resonance for eventual reassignment to the \u2018calutron\u2019 or \u2018racetrack\u2019 uranium-235 separation project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which at the time was not reaching its production goals. Lawrence asked Starr to form and lead a team of several hundred engineers, to troubleshoot the early-production calutrons through experiments performed on a smallscale model he was to construct. The ensuing improvements were incorporated into new production machines, and by the spring of OBITUARY", "authors": ["P.

Although this new group consists of relative outsiders, I argue that it is growing in influence as a source of ideas about China\u2019s future\u2014and the world\u2019s future\u2014that can push Beijing to be more assertive. To see how proclamations of building a harmonious world contributed to China\u2019s current conflicts with its Asian neighbors and Western powers, it is necessary to trace how Hu\u2019s foreign policy encourages China\u2019s officials and its citizen intellectuals to talk about post-American world orders. To explore this debate, the essay will compare Beijing\u2019s official view of \u201cbuilding a harmonious world\u201d with the views of two citizen intellectuals regarding China\u2019s future and the world\u2019s future. The works compared are Professor Zhao Tingyang\u2019s Tianxia Tixi: Shijie Zhidu Zhexue Daolun (The Tianxia System: The philosophy for the world institution) (2005) and Senior Colonel Liu Mingfu\u2019s Zhongguo Meng: Hou Meiguo Shidai de Daguo Siwei Zhanl\u00fce Dingwei (The China dream: The Great Power thinking and strategic positioning of China in the post-American age) (2010).2 The Tianxia System uses traditional Chinese ideas to craft a new world order; The China Dream argues that the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) needs a military rise to guard its economic rise. These two books are important because they exemplify how popular voices increasingly influence debate among foreign policy experts. They each became social phenomena and media events that provoked debates, which spread their influence far beyond their core audiences of philosophers and military officers into China\u2019s broader civil society.

While many assert that China will be a different kind of world leader that appeals to non-Western norms,4 these debates about future world orders show how China\u2019s citizen intellectuals are reproducing familiar themes: liberalism, idealism, and realism. Indeed, in many ways it is best to understand them in terms of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s slogan from the early reform era: \u201cSocialism with Chinese Characteristics.\u201d Many argue that China\u2019s ideology has shifted from \u201csocialism\u201d to \u201cChinese characteristics.\u201d However, this essay will show how alternative world orders each entail a productive tension between \u201csocialism\u201d and \u201cChinese characteristics.\u201d Socialism is not dead in China; although its power as a revolutionary ideology is weak, it is thriving as a lifestyle and a way of thinking that continues to inform discussions of things like the \u201cChina model\u201d and the \u201cBeijing Consensus.\u201d5 Even with its many problems, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is not about to collapse: it is the wealthiest political party in the world, has 80 million members, and is growing. Although Chinese nationalism is strong and Confucianism is a growing force, Chinese tradition does not dominate the discussion of \u201cChinese characteristics\u201d as much as people in the West might think. It is necessary, then, to pay attention to the nuance of foreign policy discussions in China to see how realism, idealism, and liberalism are combined in a range of different ways.

In other words, although predictions of American decline are popular, the U.S. is still likely to dominate global affairs for the next few decades. China\u2019s strategic futures are important, however, because they show how Chinese officials and citizen intellectuals are starting to think beyond the current world system to craft post-American world orders. Their impact thus may be more negative than positive; even if such alternative world orders are not realized, they still can serve to delegitimize Americaninfluenced global norms. For a period of time, then, the international politics would be in a disorderly interregnum between dominant world systems.7 The essay will argue two points: (1) Hu\u2019s harmonious world foreign policy has had unintended consequences: it has created opportunities for citizens to talk about a wide range of possibili", "authors": ["William A.

European leaders, therefore, should join those who insist that President Nazarbayev appoint a successor while still in good health and in power.

In June-July a wave of armed attacks and bombings followed in Aktobe and capital Astana. The government reacted by tightening control and passing an \u201cantiradicalisation\u201d bill, which the militants countered by additional attacks. Previously unknown Islamist group, Jund-al-Khalifa, claimed responsibility for attacks, earning itself extensive coverage in the media. Sporadic fighting continued till beginning of December, when it subsided. In late December a longunresolved labor dispute turned violent in the town of Zhanaozen in western Kazakhstan. Oil workers from Ozenmunaigas, a subsidiary of national oil giant KazMunaiGaz, had been on a prolonged strike since July 2011. The six-month standoff between oil workers and trade union activists on one hand and local government and company management on the other was ignored by central officials. The wage calculation dispute quickly escalated into wider protest as company management and local administration used courts, police and thugs to intimidate strikers and pressure them out of protest. Opposition used the opportunity to criticize central government and publicly offer assistance to strikers, turning what was initially a labor dispute into a political standoff. On December 16, the Independence Day, local officials were arranging for a celebration on the main square, then long occupied by the strikers. It appears that strikers responded aggressively to the plan of festivities, destroying the rally stage, loudspeakers and setting posters on fire. By some accounts, paid \u201cprovocateurs\u201d were involved in turning the strike into mass violence. The police had to use weapons, leading to 15 deaths (70 by some estimates) and many more injured. As the protests were brutally broken up in Zhanaozen, another, a more violent one broke out in the neighboring village of Shetpe on December 17, and was also dispersed using firearms. In both Zhanaozen and Shetpe angry protesters were accused of destroying government buildings and property and putting fire on local prosecutor\u2019s office and oil firm\u2019s offices. On December 18 and 19 two thousand gathered in the regional center Aktau on a peaceful rally to stop violence in Zhanaozen and Shetpe. The government\u2019s reaction to Zhanaozen challenge was fast and \u201ctraditional\u201d. On December 16, as initial protests broke out, all communications lines were blocked and troops were mobilized. Police prevented travel of outsiders to the town and several activists were arrested for demonstrating against police brutality in Almaty, the largest and most contentious city. On December 17, the police arrested seventy in Zhanaozen and Nazarbayev declared the state of emergency and curfew in the district. Prosecutor General issued a statement calling protests acts of \u201chooliganism\u201d 2 Office of the Prosecutor General later claimed communication blockade was a technical issue caused by a damaged cable and not a deliberate government act. . Government also clamped down on violent dissent in the neighboring village of Shetpe, but showed restraints with peaceful demonstrators in Aktau. Nazarbayev initially supported actions of the police against \u201cbanditry\u201d, whom he carefully distinguished from striking oilmen. Seemingly, he did not find Zhanaozen riots grave 3 Prosecutor\u2019s Office consistently referred to government challengers as \u201chooligans\u201d, though their alleged actions (arson, firing into policemen, destroying government buildings, plunder, blocking transport) should ideally have been qualified as a more serious type of crime. enough to cancel his official trip to Moscow. Alarmed by Islamist insurgency and deadly strikes by oilmen in western Mangistau, foreign media was quick to point to \u201cshaken stability\u201d and \u201ccracks in social contract\u201d. US Helsinki Commission held a talk on instability in Kazakhstan and International Crisis Group put Kazakhstan in \u201cdeteriorating situations\u201d category. The American volunteer organization, the Peace Corps, called back its volunteers in November 2011. But how real is the political danger? Are protests a harbinger of turbulent changes to come or a one-time event, well managed and killed off by the incumbents? Will any such events follow and what would be their scale? Where is the bigger threat to stability in Kazakhstan \u2013 among the wide masses or among those in top? What are the prospects for a change in Kazakhstan, given the zeitgeist of Arab Spring and Russian electoral protests? The easiest and most obvious way to proceed would be to look at the past and see if Nazarbayev faced any similar challenges in his presidency and how he managed them. However, past is a very bad predictor of the future, so while some scenarios would be elaborated, making forecasts is close to impossible in a closed information space like Kazakhstan\u2019s and any scenarios base on a ceteris paribus assumption. Analysis of past (perceived) threats to the incumbent First, when Kazakhstan reluctantly declared independence in December 1991 there were wellgrounded concerns that ethnic Slavs dominating North Kazakhstan would secede and join Russian Federation should the newly-empowered ethnic Kazakh elites push too hard on ethnic nation-building. Unlike other Central Asian ethnicities, KaISPI Policy Brief 3 zakhs were not the majority in \u201ctheir\u201d country and most of the Russian-speaking Slavic minorities (Russian and Ukrainians) were concentrated in the north of the country. President Nazarbayev successfully navigated between rising Kazakh ethno-nationalism and formal ideology of multiculturalism and over time eliminated the threat of Russian secession through encouraging internal migration of ethnic Kazakhs to the North, securing Russian Federation\u2019s support for its territorial integrity and political disempowerment of separatist forces in the North. Secession is not a threat anymore and Nazarbayev takes due credit for that. Second, similar to Russia\u2019s Boris Yeltsin, Nazarbayev had to deal with a non-compliant parliament in early nineties. Following the Russian example, Nazarbayev secured \u201cvoluntary\u201d dissolution of the parliament in December 1993, accusing it of blocking economic reforms Though most of the new MPs were staunch supporters of Nazarbayev, the second parliament also ended up disappointing him. Unhappy with the pace and mode of economic reforms, the majority of deputies handed a vote of no-confidence to the Premier. When Nazarbayev ignored the vote, a more radical faction called for Nazarbayev\u2019s resignation as well. A number of laws vetoed by Nazarbayev were overridden by parliamentary majority. Faced with such a contentious parliament, Nazarbayev had to bow to demands of MPs and fire his Premier. . The new parliament was elected under very tight government control and with Communist party banned from running. 4 M. BRILL OLCOTT, Kazakhstan: Unfulfilled Promise?, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2007, p. 102. Following this standoff, there was a seven-months-long political deadlock, with parliament acting populist and incoherent, which Nazarbayev ended through Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling that elections of 1994 were illegitimate and dissolving the parliament in March 1995. He ruled by decree for nine months, till the new Constitution was adopted in August 1995, necessitating new elections to the legislature and extending his tenure till 2000. Third big challenge to Nazarbayev regime came when a number of prominent businessmen and government officials wrote an open letter to Nazarbayev accusing his son-in-law, Rakhat Aliev, of corruption and usurping power. Signatories to the document also organized \u201cDemocratic Choice of Kazakhstan\u201d (DCK) movement to promote political reforms and limit powers of presidency and presidential family\u2019s growing influence. This was the first case of open defiance of elites against president Nazarbayev. The president acted decisively, publicly defending his son-in-law and condemning DCK. Enraged Premier Tokayev demanded that government officials who signed the letter immediately resign, but Nazarbayev simply fired them. Two members of the DCK, Mukhtar Ablyazov and Galymzhan Zhakiyanov, were subsequently arrested and imprisoned for one and four years, respectively. Following the DCK scandal Premier Tokayev had to resign, while Aliev was sent off to Vienna as an ambassador. The fourth and fifth political challenges were scandals popularly known as \u201cKazakhgate\u201d and \u201cRakhatgate\u201d. Kazakhgate scandal, involving a prominent New York banker and trader James Giffen, unfolded in 2003, when Gi", "authors": ["Anvar Rahmetov"], "citations": 1, "venue": "", "year": 2012}, "9": {"title": "Don\u2019t Fear the Reaper: The Purpose of Religious Festivals in Ancient Rome", "abstract": "This paper discusses the way the political leaders of Rome during the periods of the late Republic and early Empire used religious festivals as a way of gaining and maintaining power among the citizens. This article is available in Constructing the Past: http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/constructing/vol12/iss1/13 Don\u2019t Fear the Reaper: The Purpose of Ancestor Worship in Ancient Rome Emily Susina The ancient Roman practice of ancestor worship served as a way to \u201censure, through the medium of devout attention to their mortal relics in the tomb, comfort, refreshment, and perennial renewal of life to [the] immortal spirits.\u201d 11 The Romans believed that the spirit could live on after death, and it needed to be nourished just as it would were it still in a body. Through the practices and festivals associated with ancestor worship during the late Republic and early Empire, the leaders of Rome were able to take advantage of citizens\u2019 fears of invoking the wrath of the city\u2019s Lares to ensure that the citizens complied with the laws and traditions of the city. Such practices also allowed various leaders of Rome to push their agendas. Furthermore, the practice of sacrificing to the spirits was not only for the benefit of the dead; it also allowed ideas to be passed down through generations so that none of the experiences or knowledge of the ancestors would ever truly be lost. In believing that ancestors could communicate from beyond the grave, Roman citizens were able to continue to gain insight to situations from the city\u2019s elders long after they had left their mortal bodies. Leaders also likely used this concept in order to ensure compliance with traditional notions of Roman values and duties. Therefore, ancestor worship and its associated beliefs and festivals played an important cultural, social, and political role in ancient Rome and also allowed Roman leaders to exert a certain degree of control over citizens. In the ancient Roman belief system, the Lar is \u201cthe single deified founder of a family.\u201d 22 The Romans did not believe that the founders of their families should merely be respected or honored; instead, they thought that these ancestors should be literally worshipped as gods. Each family was responsible for worshiping and appeasing its own Lares in order to prevent hardship within the family. The title \u201cLares\u201d separated these spirits from the rest of the ancestors, referred to as the di parentes, which reminded citizens that the Lares were held in a higher regard than the rest of the dead. Each household would have had its own personal Lares, which would have been honored in a sacred part of the house known as the lararium. 33 In addition to maintaining the lararium and paying homage to their own Lares, all Roman citizens were also responsible for worshipping and honoring the city\u2019s Lares, known as the Lares Praestites. The Lares Praestites were usually depicted as young twin men, and they were often shown with a dog standing between them. In some cases, \u201cthe Lares themselves [were] dressed in dog-skins.\u201d 4 This portrayal of the Lares with a dog represented their roles as guardians of the city. The Lares were responsible for keeping the citizens safe and could be considered the cause of any hardship the city underwent. The citizens had to make sure to constantly appease the Lares to ensure that they would not turn on the city. If the Lares were angered, they could let harm come to both the citizens and the city itself. In addition to protecting the city, the Lares were also thought to be important for its success and well-being. On occasion, the Romans would ask the Lares to bless the fields before planting because they assumed \u201cif [the Lares] represent the souls of deified ancestors, they 1 J. M. C. Toynbee, Death and Burial in the Roman World (New York: Cornell University Press, 1971), 62. 2 Margaret C. Waites, \"The Nature of the Lares and their Representation in Roman Art,\" American Journal of Archaeology 24.3 (1920): 245. 3 Lesley Adkins and Roy A. Adkins, Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome (New York: Facts on File, Inc., 1994), 274. 4 Waites, \u201cNature of the Lares,\u201d 250. were... able, like other chthonic deities, to bring increase to the crops.\u201d 5 The Lares played an especially important role in major events such as wars, but they were also thought to be necessary in everyday events. For this reason, the Romans had to be sure to appease the spirits of the ancestors not only in trying times, but also in daily life. Just as failing to honor the Lares during war could cause devastation and destruction, neglecting the Lares in times of peace could cause a bad harvest or a drought. These important spirits were typically honored through \u201clibations regularly poured out... at Roman banquets... and offering to the Lares any food accidentally dropped at the table.\u201d 6 Citizens would make small sacrifices to the city\u2019s Lares at every official Roman banquet. In addition to these frequent, minor sacrifices, the Lares were worshipped and celebrated at festivals throughout the year. There was a festival dedicated specifically to the Lares each year in December, as well as festivals dedicated to all of the spirits and ancestors at several different times each year. The most important festival for the worship of the Lares was the Parentalia, which was \u201cthe feast... of parents and other kinsfolk of individual families.\u201d 7 The festival was a time to celebrate and worship one\u2019s ancestors as the protectors of the family. The last day of this festival, the Feralia, was the \u201cbest known of these days, and the only one which was a public festival.\u201d 8 The Feralia may have been the most important day of the Parentalia, but the festival actually lasted for more than a week each year, from February 13 to February 21. During this time, life within the city was dedicated almost completely to the celebration of the festival and the worship of the ancestors. For the duration of the Parentalia, \u201call temples were closed, marriages were forbidden, and magistrates appeared without their insignia.\u201d 9 5 Ibid., 244. 6 Lily Ross Taylor, \"The Mother of the Lares,\" American Journal of Archaeology 29.3 (1925): 30.1 7 Toynbee, Death and Burial, 64. 8 Fowler, Roman Festivals, 306. 9 Ibid., 308. Daily life as the Romans knew it ceased for the festival; it was more important to maintain a good relationship with the spirits of the ancestors than it was to continue with the typical types of worship and commonplace legal activities. The one similarity between all these celebrations is that they were all state-sponsored. In this way, the Roman leaders were able to control the citizens\u2019 actions and mandate the types of things that they must do for the ancestral spirits. Through these festivals, the leaders taught Roman citizens how to properly sacrifice to the spirits of the city. This compliance would likely have carried over from following rituals related to the Lares to following the laws and traditions of the city in general, which thus ensured that citizens would continue to follow the regulations of the city. Because there was no separation between church and state in ancient Rome, the political leaders were thus able to use religious beliefs and festivals to regulate the behaviors of Roman citizens. In his Fasti, Ovid also elaborates on the Roman reasons for ancestor worship and the various festivals associated with such worship. According to Ovid, failing to honor the dead could cause \u201cancestral spirits [to come] moaning from their tombs in the dead of night.\u201d 10 Appeasing the ancestors was the only way to ensure that they would not return to wreak havoc on the city and cause major hardships. At the Feralia, the citizens would \u201cbear/ Offerings to the dead... to propitiate the shades.\u201d 11 On this day, the Romans would offer sacrifices in honor of the ancestors to satisfy the demands of the ancestral spirits. This practice could be used to assuage both personal Lares, and the city\u2019s Lares. Although the Parentalia focused more on personal Lares than on the city Lares, the citizens would still have learned the proper rituals for sacrifice and worship so they could apply them to the city Lares as well. Ovid also points out in this work that the sacrifices that were given were also believed to have originated at the foundation of the city by writing that \u201cthis custom was brought to your lands, just Latinus,/ By Aeneas.\u201d 12 This legitimizes the necessity of worshipping the Lares by reminding the Roman citizens both about the foundation of the city and that ancestor worship was not a new idea \u2013 the tradition was brought to Italy by Aeneas when he brought his family\u2019s Lares with him as he fled from Troy. In reading Ovid\u2019s works, it is important to consider not only the content of the writing, but also the social context of his situation. Ovid originally dedicated Fasti to Augustus, so everything he wrote in that work would have been in an attempt to win Augustus\u2019 approval. Writing for Augustus could have caused Ovid to have been more concerned with following the letter of the law rather than his own personal opinions. It could also indicate that Augustus wanted the citizens to follow the law more closely. Ovid would essentially have been relaying Augustus\u2019 message to the people of Rome, so it is entirely possible that it was Augustus who wanted to remind the citizens that when the earlier Romans had \u201cneglected the Parentalia, Festival of the Dead, such deeds did not go unpunished.\u201d 13 In this way, Augustus could have used Ovid\u2019s works as a tool to spread messages warning the Romans of the consequences of disobeying the laws and traditions of the city. After all, if the ancestors were not treated properly, they could quickly turn on the city and it was not until \u201cneglected honour was paid to the tombs/ [that] there was an end to the portents.\u201d 14 Once the Roman citizens gave the appropriate sacrifices to the ancestors, the spirits would stop tormenting the city.

Major depression in youth is a serious psychiatric illness with extensive acute and chronic morbidity and mortality. In 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics released updated practice guidelines promoting screening of youth depression in primary care (PC) clinics across the country, representing a critical step towards increasing early depression detection. However, the challenge of bridging screening with service access remains. Even when diagnosed by PC providers, <50% of youth with elevated depressive symptoms access treatment of any kind. Thus, there is a need for interventions that are more feasible for youths and parents to access and complete\u2014and that may strengthen parents\u2019 likelihood of pursuing future, longer-term services for their child.Single-session interventions (SSIs) may offer a promising path toward these goals. SSIs include core elements of comprehensive, evidence-based treatments, but their brevity makes them easier to disseminate beyond traditional clinical settings. Indeed, SSIs can successfully treat youth psychopathology: In a meta-analysis of 50 randomized controlled trials, SSIs reduced youth mental health difficulties of multiple types (mean g=0.32). To date, one SSI has been shown to reduce youth depressive symptoms in multiple RCTs: the online \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d (GM) SSI, which teaches the belief that personal traits are malleable rather than fixed. As one example, a 30-minute GM-SSI led to significant 9-month MD symptom reductions in high-symptom youths ages 12-15 versus a supportive therapy control (N=96; ds=0.60, 0.32 per parent and youth reports). Thus, GM SSIs represents a scalable, evidence-based strategy for reducing youth depressive symptoms.GM-SSIs can also strengthen parent beliefs about the effectiveness of mental health treatment, which robustly predict whether youths ultimately access services. A recent RCT including 430 parents of youth ages 7-17 indicated that an online, 15-minute SSI teaching growth mindset of emotion (viewing emotions as malleable) significantly increased parents\u2019 beliefs that psychotherapy could be effective, both for themselves (d=0.51) and their offspring (d=0.43), versus a psychoeducation control. By helping reverse parents\u2019 low expectancies for treatment, this low-cost program may enhance parents\u2019 odds of seeking services for children with mental health needs.Accordingly, this study will test whether empirically-supported GM-SSIs can help bridge the gap between PC-based depression screening and access to depression services for high-symptom youth. Youths reporting elevated internalizing symptoms at a PC visit will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: Information, Psychoeducation, and Referral (IPR; i.e., usual care) or IPR enhanced with youth- and parent-directed online SSIs (IPR+SSI), designed to reduce youth internalizing symptoms and improve parents\u2019 mental health treatment expectancies, respectively. We predict that (1) IPR+SSI will increase parents\u2019 treatment-seeking behaviors, versus IPR alone, across 3-month follow-up; (2) IPR+SSI will reduce youth internalizing symptoms across 3-month follow-up versus IPR alone; (3) IPR+SSI will reduce parental stress and psychological distress across 3-month follow-up, versus IPR alone; (4) parents and youths will rate this service delivery model as acceptable.METHOD SUMMARY. Per youth-reported internalizing symptom elevations during a PC visit (score >=5 on the Pediatric Symptom Checklist internalizing subscale), eligible families (N=246; youth ages 11-16) will be invited to participate in the study. In online surveys, parents will self-report recent treatment-seeking behaviors, expectancies for psychotherapy, stress and psychological symptoms, and youth mental health problems, along with family and demographic information; youths will self-report symptom levels. Within the same survey, youths and parents will then be randomized (1:1 allocation ratio) to one of two experimental conditions (IPR+SSI or IPR alone); those assigned to IPR+SSI will complete an intervention feedback form immediately post-intervention. At 3-month follow-up, to assess SSI effects on parent treatment-seeking, parent stress and symptoms, and youth internalizing problems, participating youths and parents will complete the same questionnaires administered at baseline.SIGNIFICANCE. There is a need for novel, potent strategies to increase families\u2019 access to youth mental health services following PC-based symptoms screening. Ideally, such strategies would be low-cost (e.g., those that do not require new staff); involve both parents and youths to address the myriad factors that may undermine service access; and impose minimal burdens on PC providers. Results will indicate whether one such strategy\u2014providing online, low-cost SSIs to youths and parents\u2014may help reduce youth internalizing symptoms and promote treatment-seeking in parents.", "authors": ["Jessica L.

However, when a new MCHH edition is released, those with the previous editions do not have access to the updated information. A mobile app is an appealing platform to fill this gap. We developed a mobile app called \u201cKhunLook\u201d as an interactive electronic MCHH intended to assist parents in child health supervision. Objective This study describes the user requirements and development of the KhunLook mobile app, validity of parents\u2019 growth assessments, and parents\u2019 evaluation of feasibility and acceptability of the app. Methods Phase 1 was a qualitative study using individual interviews. The interview data were used to revise the prototype. In phase 2, parents were randomly assigned to assess their children\u2019s growth with the app or the MCHH. The outcomes were compared to those of the physician\u2019s assessment, and congruence was determined. In phase 3, parents evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of the app in comparison to the MCHH through a web-based survey. Results Four health care providers and 8 parents participated in phase 1. Two themes were identified: (1) the mobile app potentially counters parents\u2019 infrequent use of the MCHH with accuracy, attractiveness, convenience, and simplicity, and (2) health supervision needs to be standard, up-to-date, and understandable. KhunLook was publicly launched with a family page and 7 key features: growth and nutrition, development, immunizations, oral health, reminders for the next appointment, memories, and health advice. In phase 2, 56 parents participated in the growth parameter assessments; 34 were in the App group and 22 in the MCHH group. The outcomes of the growth parameter assessments between parents and physicians in both the App and MCHH groups were not significantly different. The congruence proportions were higher in the App group for weight and head circumference, but the differences were not statistically significant. In phase 3, 356 parents from all over Thailand participated in a web-based survey. Parents rated the app feasibility as \u201cvery easy to easy\u201d to use at higher proportions than the MCHH in all health assessment domains (growth, development, and immunizations) and ease-of-use domains with statistical significance (P<.001). The KhunLook app received a significantly higher mean score (8.59/10) than the MCHH (7.6/10) (P<.001). Most parents (317/356, 89.0%) preferred the app over MCHH. Further, 93.5% (333/356) of the parents stated that they would continue to use the app and 96.9% (345/356) would recommend others to use it. Conclusions KhunLook, a Thai mobile app for child health supervision, was developed, validated for growth assessments, and was well accepted for ease-of-use by parents.

Several weeks later, the American Cancer Society released a statement encouraging individuals to postpone cancer screenings.1 Routine pediatric visits were postponed or canceled, and emergency rooms were reserved for the sickest patients requiring emergent evaluation. Pediatric emergency room visits and pediatric hospital inpatient censuses significantly decreased. Patients with new onset diabetes presented with diabetic ketoacidosis for fear of exposure to health care institutions.2 Patients with appendicitis were noted to have delayed presentation and higher rates of complications.3 The Children\u2019s Hospital at Montefiore, an urban academic tertiary care hospital with a designated oncology floor, is the only Children\u2019s Hospital in the Bronx, the boroughwith the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City.4 The volume of patients admitted to Montefiore Medical Center at the height of the pandemic was so large that one floor of the Children\u2019s Hospital was converted into a unit for adult COVID patients, as were several conference rooms. We hypothesized that fewer pediatric cancers presented to the hospital during this time. We conducted a retrospective chart review of the number and type of new cancer diagnoses that presented to our hospital during March through June 2020 and compared it to these samemonths during each of the previous 5 years. During themonths ofMarch-May 2015-2019, we saw an average of 13.6 \u00b1 4.5 (mean \u00b1 SD) new solid tumor diagnoses (Table 1). In 2020, we saw no new diagnoses in March or May; in April we saw only four new patients with solid tumors, three of whom were sarcoma patients who presented with a long duration of symptom and were found to have metastatic disease. The fourth child had a brainstem glioma. These patients were each diagnosed and treated urgently, without any delay secondary to COVID-19. In contrast, during that same period we had an average of 5.2 \u00b1 1.2 (mean \u00b1 SD) new leukemia diagnoses, and saw four new leukemia patients during the pandemic in 2020.

Parenting behaviors and practices displayed in the home can directly impact the child\u2019s expression of ADHD symptoms, speci cally hyperactivity-impulsivity behaviors. Di erences in parenting behaviors are associated with the amount of internal anxiety and stress experienced by the parent, which o en can be reduced through implementing health daily behaviors, such as physical activity. is study sought to examine the relationship between parent physical activity levels and their child\u2019s ADHD hyperactivity-impulsivity in the home through the parenting behavior mediator of anxious intrusiveness. Ninetyve parents completed online questionnaires and a hypothetical mediated model was tested using regression and a path analysis framework. Results indicated that higher parent physical activity was associated with lower anxious intrusiveness, which was associated with lower hyperactivity-impulsivity behaviors by the child in the home. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed. Introduction Attention-de cit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed childhood disorders in the United States. With a prevalence rate of 9.4% among children, ADHD can be found in millions of households nationwide (Danielson et al., 2018). Currently, the most common form of treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents is pharmacotherapy, specifically using stimulants as a way to decrease the majority of symptoms associated with ADHD (Spencer et al., 1996). Although stimulant medication has been found to be an e ective treatment of ADHD in children, it can have some adverse side e ects such as severe sleep disturbances and appetite suppression (Noble et al., 2011; Spencer et al., 1996). Because of the potential negative side e ects of medication, parents may prefer to seek other forms of treatment that do not involve pharmaceuticals. Nearly all practitioner guidelines in the past decade regarding the management of ADHD recommend a multimodal treatment approach (CDC, 2020). is approach is largely due to the fact that one form of treatment, such as medication, does not demonstrate improvements in every single facet of a child\u2019s symptoms. Parents of children with ADHD may be able to aid in symptom reduction in ways that other treatments may not, speci cally through altering their parenting practices and behaviors. Interestingly, di erences in parenting styles are associated with di erent levels of physical activity by the parent (Jago et al., 2011; Sterrett et al., 2013). As such, the purpose of this study was to investigate the association between parents\u2019 physical activity levels and their child\u2019s ADHD symptom expression in the home. Literature Review ADHD Symptoms From a neuropsychological perspective, it is theorized that the causes of ADHD symptoms are due to an irregularly low amount of dopamine, possibly due to the weak anticipatory cell ring in the prefrontal cortex (Volkow et al., 2011; Arnsten, 2000; Tripp & Wickens, 2008). Together, the dopaminergic system and the prefrontal cortex are responsible for a wide range of functions: motor control, reward, motivation, and a ect (Cohen et al., 2002). De cits in dopamine production, as seen with people with ADHD, can lead to di erent behavior patterns relating to these cognitive processes (Steinau, 2013). ese behavior patterns are o en categorized into an inattention category and a hyperactivity-impulsivity category. e inattention construct of ADHD combines behaviors such as being easily distracted, o en loosing items, or having di culty holding attention. Hyperactivity-impulsivity encompasses excessive dgeting, talking excessively, and being o en Auburn University Journal of Undergraduate Scholarship \u201con the go.\u201d Because of adopamine de ciency, children with ADHD require more reinforcement for demonstrating desired behaviors and can be in uenced more by their immediate environment than a neurotypical child (Tripp & Wickens, 2008). Educational programs and behavior management training programs for parents of children with ADHD o en focus on addressing these behavior di erences by having parents become more active in the reinforcing and rewarding of desired behaviors in order to increase anticipatory cell ring of these behaviors so that the child can regulate their behavior on their own. Children whose parents provide a more structured and purposeful approach to their parenting tend to show improvements in their executive functioning, processing of rewards, and even academic and social functioning (Tamm et al., 2014; Tarver et al., 2015). Parenting and Child ADHD Symptoms Parents\u2019 styles, behaviors, and everyday practices can directly in uence their child\u2019s ADHD symptoms in the home. e strength of the relationship between a parent\u2019s behavior and a child\u2019s behavior can be seen through the e cacy of widely used parenting behavior management trainings, such as Parent-Child Interaction erapy (PCIT) and Triple P \u2013Positive Parenting Program ( omas & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2007). Specifically, research from these programs have demonstrated that parents who implement authoritative parenting tactics, such as creating consistent structures and establishing clear discipline expectations, report decreases inhyperactivity-impulsivity behaviors from their child in the home ( omas & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2007; Wagner& McNeil, 2008). Conversely, parents who practice authoritarian or permissive parenting styles are more likely to experience a continuation of their child\u2019s disruptive or inattentive behavioral patterns (Wagner & McNeil, 2008). In addition to parenting styles, higher parental stress and internal anxiety towards parenting can predict increases in hyperactivity-impulsivity behaviors by the child ( eule et al., 2013; Breen & Barkley, 1988). Another relevant factor, parenting anxious intrusiveness, is a term coined to describe a cluster of parenting behaviors that encompasses overprotection, domineering behavior, infantilizing, and an overgratication of the child\u2019s wishes (Becker, 1964; Reid et al., 2015). ese behaviors tend to be the opposite of what is suggested by research-backed programs, yet have not been linked with child ADHD symptoms and are important parenting behaviors relevant to child behavior. One method of lowering stress and internal anxiety in parents that shows promise is the monitoring of their own daily health behaviors, such as physical activity. Parent Physical Activity and Parenting Behaviors Exercise has shown positive e ects on parenting styles and behaviors. Parents who are more physically active tend to practice more positive or authoritative parenting behaviors, as opposed to the more maladaptive, authoritarian behaviors (Jago et al., 2011). Conversely, parents who engage in less physical activity tend to display more laissez-faire parenting behaviors or a permissive discipline parenting style (Sterrett et al., 2013). eory suggests that this relationship exists because exercise increases overall self-e cacy and alleviates stress through released endorphins, which has positive impacts on mood and behaviors (Bandura, 1989; Rebar et al., 2015). Understanding these mechanisms is important because parents of children with ADHD tend to have lower self-e cacy towards their parenting abilities (Alizadeh et al., 2007). Additional stress brought about from the behavioral symptoms of ADHD in children and from a lack of dedicated self-care time are largely responsible for these lower self-e cacy levels in parents. While there is evidence for a link between child ADHD behavioral symptoms and increased parental stress, there is not a link for how changes in parental stress levels, through daily health practices, may be related to child ADHD symptoms. is gap exists largely because of the heavy focus on various and important parenting behaviors and hyperactivity-impulsivity behaviors in children with ADHD. e Present Study is study aims to investigate the relationship between parents\u2019 physical activity levels and their child\u2019s ADHD symptom expression in the home through proposing a theoretical model involving speci c parenting practices. While this study is correlational in nature and hopes to lay the groundwork for future causal research, understanding this relationship would provide parents with speci c health behaviors that can impact their child\u2019s ADHD-related behaviors. We hypothesize that higher levels of parent exercise will be associated with fewer ADHD behavioral symptoms in their child because exercise will lower anxious intrusiveness parenting.

A Roadmap for Delivering Child Care in Agricultural Communities", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose: The \u201cProtecting Children While Parents Work in Agriculture\u201d project aims to establish safe and nurturing environments for farmworker children while their parents work. Access to good child care aids worker recruitment, improves retention, and boosts morale. However, childcare services are sometimes nonexistent, cost prohibitive, or not available when needed. Ensuring adequate services is best accomplished when childcare providers, agricultural employers, and farmworker parents work together. The Roadmap for Delivering Child Care in Agricultural Communities (Roadmap) was developed to facilitate this collaboration. Results/Findings: This project conducted focus groups, surveys, and interviews with agribusiness representatives, childcare providers, and farmworker parents. This formative research found that 90% of surveyed agribusinesses believe providing childcare services to employees\u2019 children fosters a more stable workforce, improves employee morale, and enhances company reputation. About half indicated they need guidance on how to implement these services. Interviews with childcare providers indicated that access to child care could improve with representation by the grower community. Farmworker parents stated they were more likely to choose a job in a location with childcare services, and more women would choose to work if child care was available. With these findings, the project team drafted the Roadmap, a step-by-step guide for developing childcare facilities and improving existing childcare services and access to services. It also includes evidence supporting successful agricultural safety and health interventions and how adequate child care is a beneficial investment for agribusinesses and farmworkers alike. It was reviewed by childcare providers, growers, and farmworker advocates, who all agreed the Roadmap is a useful resource they recommend to others. The project team used their feedback to refine the Roadmap language and content and provide recommendations for dissemination. To promote this to key stakeholders, the team developed a promotional video, social media toolkit, and a media release. Practical Application: Growers and other stakeholders can use the Roadmap to facilitate improved access to childcare services for their employees, including creating new childcare options. Stakeholders are encouraged to distribute this handbook in regions with large numbers of hired agricultural workers and to facilitate linkages between growers and childcare providers.", "authors": ["A.

A child\u2019s burn injuries and their treatment can also have a significant psychosocial impact on parents, affecting their health and mental well-being. Parents can experience a reactive distress including elevated stress, anger, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, guilt, marital and financial problems, and increased responsibility and load, during the acute phase of treatment. Many must also divide their time to meet the needs of any uninjured siblings, and between work, the hospital, and home. This PhD used mixed methods to explore the experiences, access to support, opinions of peer support, and support needs amongst parents and carers of burn-injured children. Thirteen interviews were conducted with parents, followed by a survey of a further 57 parents. The majority of parents reported that they were offered support, particularly during the acute phase of treatment. Most often, this was from nursing staff. Despite this, many parents also reported to feel isolated. Access to peer support has been recommended in the British Burn Care Standards (2013, 2018), and parents recognised the potential value of this. However, factors such as guilt, the pain of recollection, perceived stigma, time pressures, and distance to the hospital can make accessing such support difficult. The results of this research suggested that online delivery of supportive peer-informed information could be particularly appealing to parents, particularly that which retained the peer voice. With widespread access to the internet and growing dependence on computers and mobile devices, it is common for adults in the UK to seek health-related support and information on the Internet.

In this study, suicide reports in the New York Times were examined to establish if these guidelines affected the reporting. To determine if there was any change, all suicide reports from five years before, the year of guideline release, and five years after were extracted from the Times database. To determine compliance, articles were coded using a coding sheet that operationalized the guidelines into 12 yes-or-no questions. The New York Times observed nearly one and a half guidelines more in 2006 than 10 years before, from about 5 to nearly 6.5 observed. Some guidelines were observed differently in 2001, suggesting greater focus on the topic. However, only some of the changes were in line with the guidelines, and none of them lasted five years. Some guidelines, such as those to include intervention resources, conflicted with journalism norms and were never followed. Others, like the one discouraging front page placement, fell in line with the journalism standards of the New York Times and so were always followed. On the whole, the change in 2001 suggests that the guidelines did have an effect, but it was mixed and did not last five years. The increased observance overall suggests that the evolving standards of the New York Times agreed more with the media guidelines over the ten years.

The developed world has evolved many models for elderly care, for example, nursing home care, health insurance, etc. Indian Government has also taken multiple measures in this direction by initiating National Policy on Older Persons, 1999, the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, the Old Age Pension Scheme, Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana 2017, etc. However, there is a necessity that, India must rapidly adapt to the complex health related, social and economic challenges caused by these demographic changes. This may be an opportunity for innovation in the health system by developing a perspective for healthy and active aging, though it is a major challenge. Health care of the older people cannot be achieved unless total health, i.e., physical, social, economic, psychological, and spiritual aspects are addressed. Objective: The objective is to study current policies regarding geriatric health care in India and to propose the possibility to develop a model to provide comprehensive and dedicated health-care services to the older population by integrating conventional and indigenous systems of medicine dwelling in the country. Materials and methods: Electronic search in various scientific journals for research and review articles; electronic along with hand searching of conference proceedings, brochures, government policy documents, press releases, Ayurveda classical texts, etc., regarding geriatric health care in India and model health-care facilities in other countries and regarding of AYUSH systems in geriatric health care in India. Results: There is an urgent need of adaptation and modification in the National Health System to cater the actual requirements of the elderly with plans and strategies dedicated to face their health-related challenges.

The wolf (Canis lupus) is the most studied large carnivore in the world. After a massive decline and several local extinctions, mostly due to direct persecutions, wolves are now recolonizing many areas of their historical natural range. One of the main monitoring techniques is the howling survey, which is based on the wolves\u2019 tendency to use vocalisations to mark territory ownership in response to howls of unknown individuals. In most cases wolf howling sessions are useful for the localisation of the pack, but they provide only an aural estimation of the chorus size.We tested and present a new bioacoustic approach to estimate chorus size by recording wolves\u2019 replies and visualising choruses through spectrograms and spectral envelopes. To test the methodology, we compared: a) the values detected by visual inspections with the true chorus size to test for accuracy; b) the bioacoustic estimations of a sample of free-ranging wolves\u2019 replies developed by different operators to test for precision of the method; c) the aural field estimation of chorus size of a sample of free-ranging wolves\u2019 replies with the sonogram analysis of the same recordings to test for difference between methods.ResultsVisual inspection of the chorus by spectrogram and spectrum proved to be useful in determining the number of concurrent voices in a wolf chorus. Estimations of chorus size were highly correlated with the number of wolves counted in a pack, and 92\u00a0% of 29 known chorus sizes were recognized by means of bioacoustic analysis. On the basis of spectrographic evidence, it was also possible to identify up to seven concurrent vocalisations in a chorus of nine wolves. Spectral analysis of 37 free ranging wolves\u2019 replies showed a high correlation between the chorus size estimations of the different operators (92.8\u00a0%), but a low correlation with the aural estimation (59.2\u00a0%).ConclusionsWolf howling monitoring technique could be improved by recording wolves\u2019 replies and by using bioacoustic tools such as spectrograms and spectral envelopes to determine the size of the wolf chorus. Compared with other monitoring techniques (i.e., genetic analysis), bioacoustic analysis requires widely available informatic tools (i.e., sound recording set of devices and sound analysis software) and a low budget. Information obtained by means of chorus analysis can also be combined with that provided by other techniques.Moreover, howls can be recorded and stored in audio file format with a good resolution (i.e. in \u201cWave\u201d format), thus representing a useful tool for future listening and investigations, which can be countlessly employed without risks of time deterioration.", "authors": ["D.

Wolves howled from the core areas of their territories and not from the peripheries. Howls served as communication between temporarily separated pack mates (43% of cases), after re-union (18%) and before setting out for a hunt (22%). Very few spontaneous howls (2%) were targeted at a neighbouring pack. Wolves responded to human-simulated howling in June\u2013September, with a peak in August (reply rate: 39%). The duration of elicited howling increased significantly with group size: howls by single wolves or pairs lasted, on average, 34\u201340\u00a0s, whereas those of five to seven\u00a0wolves (including pups) had an average duration of 67\u201395\u00a0s, with a maximum length of nearly 4\u00a0min. In the populations of Polish wolves studied here, spontaneous howling served primarily for intra-pack communication.

A wolf howl is a low-frequency vocalization that can be transmitted over long distances and thus it can be used for monitoring. Elicited howling survey is a current method to monitor wolves in different areas all over the world. Elicited howling, however, may be invasive to residential wolf packs and could create possible negative reactions from the human population. Here we show that it is possible to detect wolves by recording spontaneous howling events. We measured the sound pressure level of wolf howls by captive individuals and we further found that elicited howling may be recorded and clearly identified up to a distance of 3 km. We finally conducted a non-invasive acoustic detection of wolves in a free-ranging population.

Leopold invested his life in observing nature. His keen appreciation for ecological systems became the foundation for his profound land ethic, which stressed taking the long view of humanity's relationship with nature to preserve its integrity, stability, and beauty. Such a perspective is characteristic of the gerontological worldview. Like the environmentalists whom Leopold counseled to \"think like a mountain,\" in gerontology we too take the long view of human life. When we take time to look deeply, we can see both the fragility and the strength of each human life, each tree, each creature, each stream and mountain. And we can discern the fundamental interconnectedness and interdependence in life. In this issue of Generations, we explore research and practice on aging and the environment and discuss elements that bring the two fields together. Making this connection is critical at the present time because of two societal trends: the rapidly growing aging population and mounting concern about environmental sustainability, specifically climate change. John Muir warned that \"when we tug at a single thing in nature, we find it attached to the rest of the world.\" Worsening environmental hazards are \"things that tug\" at human health in later life, including such threats as air pollution, drinking-water contaminants, heavy metals in our bodies- as well as the greatest public health threat to our world, climate change. We offer this issue to alert and inform readers about the critical importance of the environment to an aging society, and to explore how gerontologists, environmental scientists, and older people themselves can come together to find common cause. Why Should Gerontologists Address Environmental Issues? One reason that gerontologists should address environmental issues is straightforward: Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the twenty-first century (Costello et al., 2009), affecting all population groups, including older people. Writing in The Lancet, Richard Horton (2009) described a study of the threats of climate change in which \"[a] systematic review of the evidence showed that the risks from changing patterns of disease, food insecurity, unsafe water and sanitation, damage to human settlements, extreme events, and population growth and migration were far more severe for human health than most observers had understood.\" The researchers found that the threat was not only environmental and economic, but also affected human health and mortality. The recent series of scientific studies conducted by researchers from the United Kingdom and the United States for The Lancet and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (Horton, 2009) makes clear that when greenhouse gases are reduced, health benefits result in both the immediate and the long term. That health dividends are considerable is an emerging and compelling message. One study found that short-lived greenhouse pollutants such as sulphates, organic and black carbon, and ozone are significant risk factors for cardiovascular mortality. Reducing these pollutants- created primarily by combustion by-products from power, transport, and household sectors- will offer an immediate benefit for health (Horton, 2009). Reducing emissions through more walking and cycling and less use of motor vehicles will bring tremendous health benefits. Heart disease and stroke could drop by 10-20 percent, with reductions in breast cancer (12-13 percent), dementia (8 percent), and depression (5 percent) (Haines et al., 2009). Responses of species to warming across the Northern Hemisphere are well documented by changes in the timing of growth stages, especially the earlier onset of spring events, migration, and lengthened growing seasons (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). \u2026", "authors": ["K.

Reports of mountain lions increased during the 1990s, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) does acknowledge the existence of this species within the state. However, State officials continue to insist that the majority of these sightings involve former captive animals or misidentification of other species, rather than a wild population of mountain lions. The growing number of mountain lion sightings in recent years \u2014 by biologists, hunters, and other citizens \u2014 suggests that there may well be a small breeding population of the species in Michigan. History In 1984, while hunting on the Patowachie-Hannaville Indian Reservation fifteen miles west of the town of Escanaba in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a Native American hunter spotted a mountain lion ( Puma concolor) \u2014 also known as cougar or puma \u2014 while trying to spook some deer. The man quickly lifted his rifle and fired, wounding the cat, which responded by leaping ten feet into the air, and then running off with one leg flopping (Zuidema 1999). The hunter discovered bone fragments from the right front paw and proceeded to track the cat in light snow into a bog full of leatherleaf shrubs (Zuidema 1999). He collected the bone fragments and gave them to wildlife officials. Michael Zuidema, a retired Forester from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR), sent the bone samples to a wildlife lab at Colorado State University's College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in Fort Collins, where high resolution electrophoresis determined it was indeed from a mountain lion (Zuidema 1999). The mountain lion was originally part of Michigan's native fauna, at the top of the food chain with the black bear, (Ursus americanus ), the wolf (Canis lupus), and the wolverine (Gulo gulo). By the late 1800s, however, only a few of the felids still survived in remote recesses of the Upper Peninsula (UP) (Zuidema 1999). The last recorded cougar killed in Michigan was in the UP in December of 1906, near the Tahquamenon River, in Luce County (Zuidema 1999). By the early 1900s the species was listed as extirpated in Michigan (Manville 1948). It seems clear, though, that the Tahquamenon cat was not the last of its kind in the UP, or even the Lower Peninsula. Since the 1920s, there has been a steady stream of reports of the big cats, mostly dismissed by DNR officials (Zuidema 2000, pers. comm.). There are several reliable records of people seeing pumas in the late 1930s and early 1940s, including one documented record of a cougar from the Huron Mountains of Marquette County in 1937 (Manville 1948). Credible sightings of the felids also date from the 1960s to the present. From 1962-1992 there were valid reports of cougars from every county in the UP except for Keweenaw (Evers 1994). Many of those reports, though, were not verified by DNR officials (Minzey 2000, pers. comm.). Frequently, people who claim to have spotted a large felid either inform the DNR too long after the a sighting or sign, or the supposed cat turns out to be another large mammal, such as a deer or wolf (Minzey 2000, pers. comm.). In addition, a large number of reported puma sightings are in areas where wolves are known residents (Minzey 2000, pers. comm.). Recent sightings in the Upper Peninsula There is, however, conclusive evidence of mountain lions in Michigan. On Memorial Day in 1998, a puma was photographed on the grounds of Thistledowne, a Bed & Breakfast establishment near the town of Gulliver in southern Schoolcraft County (Hughes 2000, pers. comm.) (Figure1). Three fuzzy photographs through a plate-glass window were taken of the cougar as it stood outside in the yard by the gazebo along the sand dunes. The animal then ran into the woods on the shore of Seul Choix Point, on Lake Michigan (McCarthy 2001, pers. comm.). Two of the photographs show the unmistakable outline of a large felid's lithe body and rounded head. Seul Choix Point is a sandy spit of land in southern Schoolcraft", "authors": ["M.

We also studied how the residents' disability and stage of cognition modified the association between observation year and protein intake (g/body weight kg).\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo cross-sectional samples were collected in 2007 (n\u00a0=\u00a0350) and 2017-8 (n\u00a0=\u00a0476) in long-term care settings. Residents' nutrient intake was determined by a one- or two-day food record. Residents' disability was determined by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) \"personal care\" question and stage of cognition was determined by the CDR \"memory\" item.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no significant difference in energy intake between the observation years. Carbohydrates, total protein, and protein (g/body weight kg) intakes were significantly lower in 2017-8 than in 2007. Fat intake was higher in 2017-8 than in 2007. In 2017-8, the intake of some vitamins and minerals was lower (thiamine, calcium) but some higher (vitamins A, D, C, E) compared to 2007. Residents' disability (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) and observation year (p\u00a0=\u00a00.037) were significantly associated with protein intake (g/body weight kg), but the interaction was not significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.35).

Vespula germanica (Fab.) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) is an invasive social wasp that frequently forages on undepleted food sources, making several flights between the resource and the nest. Previous studies have shown that during this relocating behavior, wasps learn to associate food with a certain site, and can recall this association 1 h later. In this work, we evaluated whether this wasp species is capable of retrieving an established association after 24 h. For this purpose, we trained free flying individuals to collect proteinaceous food from an experimental plate (feeder) located in an experimental array. A total of 150 individuals were allowed 2, 4, or 8 visits. After the training phase, the array was removed and set up again 24 h later, but this time a second baited plate was placed opposite to the first. After 24 h we recorded the rate of wasps that returned to the experimental area and those which collected food from the previously learned feeding station or the nonlearned one. During the testing phase, we observed that a low rate of wasps trained with 2 collecting visits returned to the experimental area (22%), whereas the rate of returning wasps trained with 4 or 8 collecting visits was higher (51% and 41%, respectively). Moreover, wasps trained with 8 feeding visits collected food from the previously learned feeding station at a higher rate than those that did from the nonlearned one. In contrast, wasps trained 2 or 4 times chose both feeding stations at a similar rate. Thus, significantly more wasps returned to the previously learned feeding station after 8 repeated foraging flights but not after only 2 or 4 visits.

In particular, he charts the rise of the specialized food and drink outlet at Pompeii, marked out in the archaeological record by distinctive masonry counters, which in themselves represent a marked growth in capital investment in retail. For Ellis, this is all part of a general Augustan economic upturn (p. 175). However, demographic expansion is also identified as key here (p. 177), and it is not always clear if the increased demand for food and drink outlets is down to a rise in urban living standards, or simply a consequence of increased levels of urbanization, with growing numbers of people reliant on the market to supply their needs. His ultimate conclusion here is that there were not just more shops than ever before in the early empire, but that they were much more specialized ones; it was, he claims, \u2018a period that gave rise to the Roman retail city\u2019 (p. 186). Ellis is surely correct to place retail at the centre of the Roman urban experience, but this does not in itself rely on the taberna, and beyond the development of bars at Pompeii, this specialization is not fully demonstrated, nor are the changes to production that drove a move away from the small-scale urban workshop explored in any detail. The vast majority of tabernae in the archaeological record remain generic in form, and could presumably have been used for a wide variety of functions. Ellis\u2019 third and final \u2018retail revolution\u2019 marks the rise of retail homogenization in the early second century (chapter 7), with increasingly standardized shops with shuttered doorways and entrances on the right-hand side being constructed as part of much larger building complexes, incorporating shops, apartments and public spaces. I would argue that this standardization and ubiquity in fact reflect the flexibility of these units, rather than suggesting any standardization of retail practices; after all, it is often just the footprint of these units that survives, telling us very little about how they were used in antiquity. Ellis\u2019 concluding chapter considers the role of retail in the Roman city (chapter 8), although the focus is primarily on the place of bars in urban life. This discussion is important and interesting in its own right, but to a certain extent reflects the tension inherent throughout this book between the study of food and drink outlets specifically and the retail trade more broadly. There is little in this final chapter about the wider role of retail, about supply chains, about who staffed these shops, about the customers, about their profitability, and so on. There is some internal contradiction here, as earlier in the book Ellis claimed that shops were not particularly lucrative and that they were often staffed by freedmen, but the implications are not discussed further here. If this were indeed the case, then retail was not part of any economic boom per se, nor were shops openly available on the rental market to independent entrepreneurs. In this final analysis, however, retail is explicitly linked to economic growth. The development of food-and-drink outlets in particular reflects increased standards of living, fulfilling more of a want than a need; it is here that we see \u2018cashed-up urbanites\u2019 (p. 245) choosing to spend their money in bars, offering an economic opportunity for retailers. Retail was for a long time neglected in studies of the ancient economy, rejected in favour of long-distance trade and a focus on production, rather than consumption. It is only recently that the retail trade has started to attract the interest that it deserves and Ellis makes an important contribution to this growing body of work. He offers a detailed study of the taberna in the archaeological record, confidently handling a vast amount of data and demonstrating the complexity not only of the world of the taberna, but also of the social, economic and political setting of the urban centres in which they operated.", "authors": ["Ruth M.

Seven edible plant species were also used as herbal medicines. We also recorded 39 species used for other purposes in Monpa daily life. These included nine species that were used to make agricultural tools, five species for dyes and mordants, four species for timber, three species for fuelwood, four species for religious ritual use, three species for washing, two species for incense, two species for thatching, two species for fiber (rope and paper), two \u201ccalendar plants\u201d were used to indicate seasons for agricultural purposes, two fish poison plant species, and one species were used as a tobacco substitute. Based on taxonomic insights and from studies elsewhere, we suggested that fiber species were under-reported (c. 14 species were used vs. one species reported used). Even though these plant species are rich and diverse, the use of endemic or near-endemic species was rarely recorded in previous studies. These species included Arenga micrantha (used for starch), Hornstedtia tibetica (fruits), Castanopsis clarkei (edible nuts) and Gnetum pendulum (edible nuts), Ophiorrhiza medogensis (vegetables), Derris scabricaulis (fish poison), Radermachera yunnanensis (agricultural tools), Litsea tibetana (seed oil), Dendrocalamus tibeticus (wine strainers and implements for administering medicine), Zanthoxylum motuoense (spices), Cinnamomum contractum (tobacco substitutes), Morus wittiorum (medicines), and Garcinia nujiangensis (funeral rituals). Despite the absence of roads until 2013 and the impression of \u201cisolation,\u201d Monpa knowledge of plant use reflects three categories of change. Firstly, oral histories of plants used in Bhutan were also encountered by Monpa people after their migration from Bhutan to south-eastern Tibet. Secondly, a \u201cslow change\u201d through centuries of exchange of knowledge (for example of Chinese and Tibetan medical systems), seeds of introduced crops (finger millet (indigenous to Africa), maize (from Meso-America)), and experimentation and use of introduced medicinal plants (such as Datura stramonium , which originates from North America). Thirdly, \u201cfast change\u201d over the past decade. This is reflected in changes in traditional architecture and in rising commercial trade in selected plant resources such as Dendrobium orchid stems and Paris polyphylla rhizomes which are in demand in China\u2019s Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) markets). Conclusions Monpa people in the south-eastern Tibet have detailed knowledge of the diverse plant resources. But that traditional knowledge is now faced with a crisis because of the modern socio-economic change. In addition, Monpa knowledge of plants reflects slower changes in knowledge as well. For example, Monpa ethnomedicine has been influenced by traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicine over a longer period in time. Overall, this study provides a deeper understanding of the Monpa peoples\u2019 knowledge on wild plants, including endemic and near-endemic species whose uses have not been previously recorded. Several of these narrowly distributed species, such as the fish poison Derris scabricaulis , could be the focus of further studies. Some wild edible plants may also have interesting dietary constituents which need in-depth studies. These detailed studies could enable the Monpa people to benefit from the use of their traditional plant-derived culture and therefore support the biodiversity conservation.", "authors": ["Shan Li", "Yuanqin Zhang", "Yongjie Guo", "Lixin Yang", "Yuhua Wang"], "citations": 9, "venue": "Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine", "year": 2020}, "8": {"title": "P300-tracking of changes in information processing / working memory in preclinical alzheimer\u2019s and mild cognitive impairments (MCI)", "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a presently incurable disease with a significant health burden, with a prevalence of 5.8 million Americans as of2019. Prognosis as well as more effective treatment regimens could be greatly augmented by reliable means of diagnosis in the earlier stages of development. Efforts to characterize impairments in memory in pre Clinical AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) range from the domain involved (episodic, semantic, working, perceptual, or visuospatial), to storage (sensory, long-term, short-term, explicit, implicit, autobiographical and morpheus), to memory processing including working memory or information processing (encoding, storage, and retrieval). An emerging area of research aims to determine whether detectable impairments in encoding, storage or retrieval have the ability to serve as hallmarks of pre Clinical Alzheimer\u2019s and early MCI giving both clinicians and patients a window of opportunity to halt or reverse progression to AD via early treatment options. For the identification of event related potential (ERP) markers, the P300 has shown promise as a state-of-the-art new device. While prolonged P300 latency recorded via electroencephalograph\u2019s (EEG) like BrainView NeuralScan is seen in normal aging, individuals with AD exhibit more prolonged P300 latencies and frontal-dominant P300 distribution when compared to normal individuals of the same age. Key questions now remaining include whether identification of these EEG hallmarks identified with the assistance of devices such as the P300 may provide us with an earlier timeframe in the diagnosis, prognosis and early treatment for AD, as well as providing crucial insights into mechanisms of its early pathogenesis. *Correspondence to: Jonathan RT Lakey, PhD, MSM, Department of Surgery, 333 City Blvd West, Suite 1600, Orange, CA 92868, USA, E-mail: jlakey@uci.edu Received: May 29, 2020; Accepted: June 26, 2020; Published: June 29, 2020 SCD are >60 years and b) <30% of individuals with SCD test biomarker positive [29-34]. In 2019 a study inferred that the P300 an event related potential (ERP) marker was able to differentiate with 100% accuracy between individuals with new-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and normal subjects [35]. The study also suggested that the P300 elicited using the task-drive odd-ball paradigm recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) machines like BrainView NeuralScan could be potentially used to detect AD in the pre-clinical stage [35]. In 2019 it was estimated that 5.8 million Americans had AD [36]. In general, normal aging exhibits \u201cdecline in\u201d \u2013 recall, episodic memory, processing speed and divided attention, while implicit memory and recognition remains \u201cstable\u201d with semantic memory, crystallized IQ and emotional reasoning improving till \u224860 years of age [37-39]. Beginning with \u201closs of memory\u201d (inability to encode or retrieve recent memories) individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) subsequently complain of difficulty with attention, planning, semantic memory, and abstract thinking. Further progression of AD results in greater memory loss, language difficulties, failure to recognize close family and friends, emotional instability and finally loss of control over bodily functions [37-39]. The present article will describe the changes in working memory (WM) and information processing in pre-clinical AD and MCI Miranda P (2020) P300-tracking of changes in information processing / working memory in preclinical alzheimer\u2019s and mild cognitive impairments (MCI) J Syst Integr Neurosci, 2020 doi: 10.15761/JSIN.1000233 Volume 7: 2-9 captured via the P300. The benefit of state-of-the art EEG machines like BrainView NeuralScan (Figure 1) is that in addition to ERPbased (i.e. P300) identification of preclinical AD, brain mapping using quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), and source localization using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) imaging to identify Brodmann areas (BA) affected is possible. Thus the clinician can micro-monitor progression and titer treatments using ERPs like the P300 and at the same time be able to identify areas of the cortex that are involved which in turn allows them to anticipate which cortical functions might be compromised in the future. Working memory and Information processing Deficit in episodic memory is a key impairment seen in early AD. Working memory (WM) defined as \u201cthe capacity to hold information that is absent in mind for brief periods of time\u201d [35,36]. The model consists of the central executive that controls and regulates the function of the phonological loop (articulatory loop and acoustic store), the episodic buffer and the visuospatial sketchpad; allocating attention to current relevant tasks and block out irrelevant tasks. In the WM model the three processes in memory formation include: information encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Long-term memories are formed when information is transferred from short-term to permanent episodic representation by rehearsal [35,36]. Early AD memory complaints revolve around encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of information, deficits in the acquisition of new information (encoding) and retention or retrieval deficit in early AD remains equivocal [37-50], P300 and Theories on P300 Neurocognitive functional connectivity markers like the P300 that use EEG/MEG/event related potentials) in combination with resting state or goal-driven oddball paradigms (tasks/attention/visual/auditory/ response inhibition Go/NoGO) to elicit and study brain function are sensitive [35-41,51-57]. They have the potential to demonstrate abnormal diffuse slowing, delay and suppression of responses to sensory and cognitive stimuli, identify pre-clinical AD, in treatment evaluation be it medication (eg.: effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on AD Figure 1. Report summarizing the results of visual and auditory processing, attention, working memory/information processing evaluated using the P300 and resting EEG (eyes open and eyes closed) using BrainView NeuralScan by Medeia Miranda P (2020) P300-tracking of changes in information processing / working memory in preclinical alzheimer\u2019s and mild cognitive impairments (MCI) J Syst Integr Neurosci, 2020 doi: 10.15761/JSIN.1000233 Volume 7: 3-9 patients), neurofeedback or neurotherapy [35-47,51-63]. Among them, the P300 recorded using EEG machines like BrainView NeuralScan by Medeia (Figure 1) captures information processing memory, attention, executive function with the dopamine-mediated P300a playing a key role in frontal working memory (WM) function while medial temporal lobe generated P300b component, is norepinephrine-mediated [48,49]. P3a reflects orientation to a nontarget deviant stimulus, focal attention, engagement of attention, processing novelty executive function [5053,62-65]. Decline in P3a amplitude has been shown to correspond to decreased attention and executive function in mild AD indicative of its potential as a preclinical marker of AD and aiding clinicians in arriving at a more objective diagnosis and treatment titration [50-53,62-65]. Theories on P300 include i) stimulus evaluation hypothesis subsequently refuted [66-68], ii) Sokolov\u2019s context-updating hypothesis environment i.e. updating occurs when relevant stimuli are presented [60,69-71], iii). context-closure hypothesis namely; first consolidation of stimuli is carried out to achieve a meaningful context and when this is followed by background stimuli i.e. the meaningful event is over. closure is initiated [70,72-74]. Other trivia to keep in mind include; P300 latencies and larger amplitudes reflect superior information processing with the converse indicating decline in cognitive function [60,70,74-78]. 60% of P300 morphology observed is individual specific and stable showing little variation over recording sessions/trials and with morphology, reaction times (RTs), 75% of speed and errors positively correlated with age [79-88]. Individual variations in P300 mediated by arousal levels are guided by an individual\u2019s traits, state (natural and biological eg. body temperature, sleep quality, exercise, food intake, drugs) and physiological properties (anatomical features of the corpus callosum or skull thickness) [86-88]. Systematic and meta-analytic reviews on P300 Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the auditory P300 and age based on both a systematic and meta-analytic review of 75 studies (n=2811) [89]. Age-related degenerative effects include increase in P300 latencies and decline in amplitude [90,91]. This coupled with changes in white matter integrity influence executive dysfunction in the elderly [90,92,93]. To compensate for this decline older adults recruit other neural networks mediated in the prefrontal cortices to help meet the task as hand however once a particular threshold is crossed this is no longer possible and decline in cognitive performance can be seen (\u2018CRUNCH\u2019 model) [85,94-108]. In a clinical trial on 103 with mild AD and 101 healthy controls (HC) between 60 and 90 years of age Cecchi et al. evaluated suitable ERP markers of mild AD. P3a amplitude (\u03bcV) differed significantly between healthy controls (HC, n=101) 5.88\u00b10.19 and those with mild AD (n=103) 3.63\u00b10.20** following a distractor (white noise) stimulus. Latency (ms) did not appear to be significantly different between HC 417.3\u00b12.4 and those with AD 419.8\u00b13.0 [70]. Both P3b amplitude (\u03bcV) differed significantly between healthy controls (HC) 6.03\u00b1 0.20 and those with AD 4.42\u00b10.20** following a target (2000 Hz) stimulus as well as latency (ms) HC 396.0\u00b12.8, AD 419.6\u00b13.3* [109]. Pedroso et al. carried out a systematic review of 8 studies (Caravaglios et al., O\u2019Mahony et al., Lai et al., Yamaguchi et al., Golob & Starr, Bennys et al., Juckel et al. and Frodl et al.) that examined the auditory P300 amplitude and latency in AD [110-118].

Looking specifically at Mansfield and snack food, Woolf and armchairs and Elizabeth Bowen and hats and gloves, it explores the ways in which each type of object models a particular way of reading. Pitched against conceptions of the novel as the most apt literary vehicle for ideas and modernism as a highfalutin and inaccessible enterprise, it argues that the modernist short story is a philosophical form which encourages revelatory reading in quotidian contexts. Through examination of the intrinsic interrelation between stories and everyday objects, each fitting ergonomically around the other in terms of their production, consumption and contents, this thesis calls for a reappraisal of the importance of the short fiction genre to the development of modernist aesthetics. It conceives of Katherine Mansfield\u2019s short fiction as a type of literary snack: accessible, quickly consumed and working against restrictive traditions. Examining moments of snacking in Mansfield\u2019s short fiction via Walter Benjamin\u2019s conception of Jetztzeit (from \u2018Theses on the Philosophy of History\u2019, 1940) \u2013 time that is poised, abundant and filled with potential revolutionary energy \u2013 it argues that snacks and stories allow access to the insight enabled by the \u2018presence of the now\u2019. Next, it goes on to consider how the armchair functions in Woolf\u2019s stories as both noun and adjective; a space for reading stories and the wider world, which also encourages a democratising, amateur perspective. Employing Martin Heidegger\u2019s concept of phenomenology as necessitated by a questioning mode of being (as set out in Being and Time, 1927), it suggests both the armchair and story as routes to authentic being. Finally, it examines Bowen\u2019s short fiction, exploring peripheral detail as epitomised by hats and gloves as philosophical expression of her emphasis on the eccentric. Using Jacques Derrida\u2019s notion of the parergon from The Truth in Painting (1987) as a framework for examining Bowen\u2019s aesthetics, it establishes accessory detail in her stories as a rich and anarchic site of meaning which encourages eccentric and creative reading practices.

Three years earlier, the patient received a diagnosis of T2DM based on Diabetes Canada criteria.1 At the time of diagnosis, he had intermittent hyperglycemia, a high 2-hour glucose reading on his oral glucose tolerance test (20.5 [normal < 11.1] mmol/L) and a negative GAD65 antibody level (< 3.0 [normal < 5.0] U/mL). His high body mass index (31.9, > 97th percentile), the presence of acanthosis nigricans and an elevated fasting insulin level (277 [normal 35\u2013140] pmol/L), although not diagnostic, were supportive of a diagnosis of T2DM. The patient began dietary and lifestyle interventions. Medical therapy escalated since diagnosis to include metformin and insulin owing to suboptimal glycemic control. A timeline of events is shown in Figure 1. The patient completed diabetes self-management education that included information on nutrition, insulin, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, management during an intercurrent illness and ketone management according to standard-of-care clinical practice guidelines. Despite this, his hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) averaged 9%. His diabetes self-management was characterized by fingerstick glucose monitoring 0\u20132 times daily, frequent insulin omission and suboptimal adherence with metformin. His GAD65 antibody level remained negative. He had had no episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hypoglycemia. Two months before presentation, the patient\u2019s primary care provider prescribed canagliflozin (a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 [SGLT-2] inhibitor) starting at 100 mg/d and titrated to 300 mg/d. His prescribed therapy also included metformin (1500 mg at bedtime), insulin glargine (30 units at bedtime) and insulin lispro (1 unit for 3 g of carbohydrate with meals and snacks). At the time our patient presented to hospital he reported that 5 days earlier, on day 1 of his illness, he had decreased his prandial insulin on his own volition because of \u201clow\u201d blood glucose (about 8 mmol/L). He was fearful of hypoglycemia because of decreased intake and vomiting, which led him to stop taking his insulin and metformin; he continued to take canagliflozin. He had not monitored blood glucose or ketones for the 5 days before his presentation to hospital, nor used the telephone assistance service provided by the diabetes centre. On initial assessment, the patient had the following vital signs: heart rate of 130 beats/min, blood pressure of 146/92 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min with Kussmaul respiration, oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, body temperature of 36.7\u00b0C and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. He was pale, with sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes and abdominal tenderness with no features of peritonitis. The patient had a serum glucose level of 17.4 (normal 3.3\u2013 11.0) mmol/L.

If the parents do not have to money to send their children to a program that requires some form of payment, the parents turn to free afterschool programs that are based at the school site. These programs are usually academic-based and provide help with homework, as well as other enrichment activities. Bringing community members into these programs allows students to have more opportunities that help to expand their thinking.

MORE THAN JUST HOMEWORK HELP AND SNACK 4 Meeting MLOs for Liberal Studies B.A. When I first started my undergrad career at California State University, Monterey Bay, I had not fully committed to the Liberal Studies department. I was unsure what I wanted to do with my time in Monterey, and it was not until I committed to Liberal Studies major that I rekindled my love for wanting to become an elementary school teacher. The professors that I encountered on my journey through the Liberal Studies major and Human Development minor have helped me grow as a future educator and as the woman that I am today. The first service learning class that I took, Intro To Public Education (LS 298) with Annette LeTourneau, helped to kick start my love for being in the classroom and the steps towards becoming a developing educator. Before taking this class, I did not know how many different things were involved and implemented into classrooms. I simply thought that I would walk into the class and hope that everything worked out. Innovative Approach to Schooling (LS 383), with Tessa Mauro, also opened my eyes to all of the types of schooling that there are in the world. I believe in order to be a successful educator, a person needs to be willing to realize that there is more than meets the eye. Both of these classes and professors guided me towards meeting the Major Learning Outcome #1: Developing Educator. Becoming a teacher, it is important to realize that there will be diversity in the classroom, especially in California classrooms. Because of this, it is important to successfully meet the Major Learning Outcome #2: Diversity and Multicultural Scholar. Dr. Antonio Gallardo allowed me to grow in his class, Diversity in Educational Settings (LS 391). The class was a safe place where tough discussions about diversity and multiculturalism were able to happen. Multicultural Literature for Children and Young Adults (LS 394) taught me how to bring multicultural books and ideas into the classroom so that all the students feel like they are represented one way or MORE THAN JUST HOMEWORK HELP AND SNACK 5 another. It is critical that students feel like they are important and matter, even if they are different from the majority of the class and population. Not one specific course in the Liberal Studies department focuses on the Major Learning Outcome #3: Innovative Technology Practitioner, but I was able to meet this outcome with the help of Dr. Rob Weisskirch and the Human Development classes I have taken. Writing papers, collecting data and results, researching different topics are just some of the components that helped me to fulfill this outcome. I had to learn how to use different types of technology and resources in order to succeed in these courses. In order to be a successful teacher in the future, I have to be willing to learn and stay up to date with technology practices as they continue to change over time. The courses, Social Foundations of Multicultural Education (LS 398) and Teaching for Social Change (LS380), have taught me what it means to be a Social Justice Collaborator and fulfilling Major Learning Outcome #4. There are multiple injustices in education that students and teachers face on a daily basis. Participating in discussions and service learning activities through these courses have allowed me to be creative with finding ways to fix or cope with these injustices. I plan to take what I have learned and put these practices into place when I have a classroom of my own in the near future. In order to successfully pass the two tests necessary to become a teacher, I had to meet Major Learning Outcome #5: Subject Matter Generalist. Intro to Earth Sciences (GEOL 210), Social and Political History of California (SBS 386), and Nature of Language & Language Acquisition (LING 392) are just some of the classes that I took in the past four years have helped me in passing the CBEST and CSET. These classes, along with others, have challenged me in MORE THAN JUST HOMEWORK HELP AND SNACK 6 attaining knowledge in various subject areas that I need to know on my journey of becoming an elementary school teacher. My final capstone project and essay, is the missing puzzle piece for successfully completely all of the Liberal Studies MLOs that I need in order to graduate. On my path to becoming an educator and bringing the community into an afterschool program, I have become a developing educator, diversity and multicultural scholar, innovative technology practitioner, social justice collaborator and finally a subject matter generalist. In order to successfully complete by project and paper, I needed to reflect on all of these MLOs and let them guide me toward the end of my undergrad career. These MLOs have made it possible for me to research and focus on the important aspects of bringing the community into after school programs in the area. Introduction Parents who are not able to pick up their children right after school or need extra help with homework have the option to send their students to after school programs. There are multiple after school programs those children of different age ranges can choose to attend. Numerous after school programs focus on helping the students with the homework, while others focus on activities that are not specifically school or homework based. Not all of the after school programs that are available are free to students; there are a few that parents have to pay monthly for in order for the students to attend. The programs for which parents have to pay typically offer different activities in which the children can participate because the program has money that is available to use as well as the necessary staff members to help facilitate those activities. Not all parents have the ability to pay for their students to attend these types of programs though. Because of this, their students attend the free after school programs. These programs are still MORE THAN JUST HOMEWORK HELP AND SNACK 7 great programs for the students, but many of the programs might not be able to incorporate outside activities depending on the amount of staff and funding that is available at the time. Families that do not have the means to pay for after school programs and activities should be able to feel confident about their decision on the free program their student attends. Working at the After School Academy, ASA, at Del Rey Woods Elementary School in Seaside, this topic has become extremely important to me. This is a grant-based program that receives its money based on the amount of students that attend on a daily basis. The students in ASA are primarily Hispanic or Latino and come from lower income families. The program provides all the students with a free snack after school, and then helps with their homework. A majority of the students are not able to get homework help from their parents when they go home, so it is important that the staff members are able to provide this help to all of the students that attend the program. After the students finish their homework, ASA encourages them to read for at least 30 minutes before they can go to recess and play. This simple task can be difficult to a majority of the students because they are not interested in reading and do not have the attention span to sit in their desk any longer than they already have. Because of this, we are constantly trying to refocus the students and keep them interested and engaged in the task they have to complete. Once a good amount of students have finished their homework and reading, one of the staff members goes outside with those kids while the other staff is still in the classroom helping the rest of the students finish up their homework and reading. Because there are not enough staff members to work with the kids who have finished homework, the kids get recess time instead of doing other activities inside or outside of the classroom.

The Sun rises early, and daylight lasts long into the evening hours. Perhaps it's the lack of bells to define our schedules, or maybe it's metabolic--but our perception of time is very different in June, July, and August. It's not that teachers can't find plenty to do--just catching up on all the chores we put aside during the school year could fill a day or two. But how about using those extra daylight hours for something inspirational? Morning to night, there's something to refresh your spirit and renew your professional skills in NSTA Recommends (see \"On the web\"). In this article, Recommends reviewers share their summer reading suggestions for teachers! The morning bell Wake up with The Robin Makes a Laughing Sound by Sallie Wolf (2010). It's the perfect bedside companion when the chatter of that red-breasted American thrush starts early in the morning. This little book is the perfect journal model: The author observes, sketches, researches, and writes poetry about birds. Whether you choose to spend the rest of your day bird-watching or not, you won't be able to avoid starting your own journal. Wolf inspires the sort of self-reflective observations that characterize scientists, and shares a lot of factual--and fanciful--information about birds. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] For many folks, the day begins best with a walk. If you're a city dweller, Stories in Stone (Williams 2009) provides the ideal preparation for your journey past buildings and human structures. From Salem limestone--the Mississippian rock that forms the backbone of many of the buildings in Chicago--to the marble used by Michelangelo and other sculptors, this book describes the science, history, and human-interest stories embedded in these structures. Look up: Even the slate roof above your head has a story of its own, which David Williams tells in a narrative you just can't put down. Another must-read for anyone who walks or journals during the summer is one of this year's NSTA/ Children's Book Council (CBC) Outstanding Science Trade Books for Students K--12: Ubiquitous by Joyce Sidman (2010). This big book of poetry gives attention to those organisms we often step on or over--or simply ignore--when we're busy. Ants, geckoes, grass, and lichens are all honored in lyric lines, and then described in exacting science. This book will not only enrich your summer walks and inspire your journal observations, but will also provide you with memorable excerpts to share with students in the fall. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Coffee break By the time you return from your walk, you might be ready for a cup of coffee and a snack. Two new student-targeted books from NSTA Press offer the sort of short mental challenges that fascinate teachers, too--and you can \"dog-ear\" your favorites to share with students in the fall. Recommends reviewer Thomas Brown suggests Earth Science Puzzles by Kim Kastens and Margie Turrin (2010). The authors use authentic data that focus on the essential concepts studied in Earth science classes.

Although the pathophysiology is unclear, the concomitant presence of transfusion related iron overload, insulin resistance, and beta cell destruction are thought to contribute in the development of DM in this population (Cooksey et al, 2004). \n \nThe oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and serum hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels are commonly used screening tools for diabetes, and have been shown to be valid in individuals with obesity amd family history of diabetes. However, the utility of HbA1c measurement is limited in thalassemia since both hemoglobinopathies and transfusions are known to interfere with HbA1C analysis. The results may be falsely increased or decreased depending on the proximity to transfusion, shortened erythrocyte lifespan and the assay used (Bry et al, 2001; Spencer et al, 2011; Sacks, 2003). Given the above limitations, OGTT has been proposed as the recommended screening method for glucose abnormalities in thalassaemia. However, the OGTT procedure requires patients to fast, is cumbersome and time consuming. \n \nContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems is a new technology that measures glucose concentrations in a continuous fashion, with the use of a sensor that is placed subcutaneously. CGM provides information on glucose excursion in relationship to meals and daily activities, and hence, has added a vital dimension in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to hyperglycemia and management of subjects with diabetes or abnormal OGTT and HbA1c results. In this paper, we set out to evaluate the utility of CGM in subjects with TM, given the limitations of HbA1C and OGTT in this population. The study also documents elevated HbA1C results using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in TM regardless of glycemia. \n \nThe Weill Cornell Medical College standard of care for patients with TM involves yearly screening for DM via OGTT. We invited all adults with TM who presented for their annual OGTT to wear a CGM sensor and have HbA1C measured as part of a larger study that examined relationship between CGM and OGTT results. Five subjects agreed to partake in wearing sensors and twelve had HbA1C measurements. \n \nAll underwent OGTT per protocol. CGM was performed using the Medtronic I Pro 3 day blinded glucose sensor. The sensor was inserted per manufacturer\u2019s recommendations into the subcutaneous tissue compartment of the abdomen. The subjects were instructed to wear the sensor at all times for 72 hours. The subjects were additionally asked to check finger stick glucose (FSG) levels using a glucometer at least four times a day for calibration and comparison purposes. They were asked to keep a detailed log of meals and snacks, exercise, and any medication use. Three days later, the subjects returned for sensor removal, at which time the data was analyzed using version 1.2a of the Medtronic Solutions software. HbA1C was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), normal range: 4 to 6%. All 12 subjects had elevated HbA1c with no clear correlation to the results of their OGTT. Mean HbA1C results were 7.4 % in 3 patients with normal glucose tolerance, 7.33% in 3 patients with pre-diabetes, and 8.16% in 6 patients with DM. \n \nOf the five subjects who underwent CGM, three (#1, 2 and 3) met the criteria for DM based on the two hour glucose value on OGTT above 11.0 mmol/L (Table I). Two of the five subjects (#4 and 5) had normal glucose tolerance (Table I). The FSG which showed normal pre and post meal glucose readings, including in those who had an abnormal OGTT. Complete CGMS data were retrieved and downloaded for all the subjects. Results were normal in all cases. None of the subjects showed the degree of glucose variability seen during OGTT, despite reporting equal and at times greater carbohydrate intake per meal than the glucose load during OGTT. Figure 1 shows the discrepancy between the OGTT and CGM data for the three subjects with DM on OGTT. \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \nDiscrepancy between OGTT results (on the left) and their corresponding CGM (on the right). OGTT results reveal glucose concentrations above 11.0 mmol/L (200 mg/dl) at 120min, which is consistent with DM. In contrast, all glucose values by CGM are within ... \n \n \n \n \n \nTable I \n \nSubjects characteristics with discrepancies between OGTT and CMS, and their HbA1C, OGTT and CGMS results. \n \n \n \nTransfusion dependent TM and DM have a unique and incompletely understood relationship. Similar to other transfusion dependent diseases, the risk of iron overload remains substantial despite improved methods of chelation, resulting in a high prevalence of DM in this population (Vogiatzi et al, 2009; Cooksey et al, 2004). Multiple large scale studies have demonstrated that patients with type 2 DM are at an increased risk for cardiovascular complications, with post-prandial hyperglycemia being a significant risk factor (King et al, 1999; Nathan et al, 2005; Hanefeld et al, 1996; Cengiz, 2009; Blake et al, 2004). Although the significance of similar carbohydrate abnormalities in the aging TM population is unclear at this time, it is reasonable to assume that they are predisposed to the same long term complications, morbidity, and mortality, making accurate and timely diagnosis of DM critical. The onset of hyperglycemia in patients with TM can be insidious and silent. Patients may go through extended periods of impaired glucose tolerance and variable degrees of glycemic excursions. The additional inflammatory stimulus caused by iron deposition, coupled with hyperglycemia, leads to the potential for significant micro and macro vascular complications (Cooksey et al, 2004). \n \nCurrent ADA guidelines recommend screening \u201cat risk populations\u201d with either fasting glucose and insulin levels, random HbA1c levels, or a formal oral glucose tolerance test. These screens impose a burden on patients with TM who are already coming in regularly for transfusions. Glucose and insulin levels require the patients to fast, while the OGTT is invasive and time consuming. Furthermore, the use of HbA1c as a screening tool for DM or assessment of glycemic control is inappropriate in TM. Transfusions may contain hemoglobin molecules exposed to glucose concentrations that are different from those of the transfusion recipient. Data from old literature suggests that high concentration of glucose in the RBC storage medium promotes glycation of the packed RBC and raises HbA1c values in the transfused patients. These findings were not confirmed in recent studies using current blood bank procedures. Moreover, they indicate that transfusions reduce the HbA1c concentration in diabetic patients due to dilution (Spencer et al, 2011). Hemoglobinopathies including thalassemia syndromes, factors that impact red blood cell survival and age, uremia, hyperbilirubinemia, and iron deficiency may all alter HbA1c test results (Herman et al, 2012). Racial and ethnic differences, genetic variation in hemoglobin glycation and assay methodology may also influence the results (Herman et al, 2012). Specific to this report, HPLC is widely used and, in general, is considered superior to immunoassays. However, hemoglobin variants may create an abnormal peak very close to the HbA1C peak, which interferes with HbA1C reading leading to spurious results. In such case, a visual inspection of the HPLC chromatogram may give valuable information regarding hemoglobin variants (Bry et al, 2001), but this is not an established procedure in commercial laboratories. The persistently elevated HbA1C values by HPLC in TM may result in unnecessary and potential life threatening medical interventions. \n \nCGM is a powerful tool to assess diabetes control and the effect of medical management. CGM gives a detailed recording of glucose excursions under daily activities. All three patients who were found to be diabetic by OGTT had normoglycemia by CGM, which is an unexpected finding. We acknowledge the limitations related to small sample size. We can also offer limited insight as to the mechanism. OGTT entails the ingestion of a large bolus of simple sugar. In contrast during CGM, subjects consume a variety of simple and complex carbohydrates, which may evoke different response of gut mediated hormones. Studies evaluating alpha and beta cell reserve and function in Thalaessemia suggest that the effect of iron deposition and inflammation on the pancreatic islets may result in both alpha and beta cell damage (De Sanctis et al, 1985). This type of injury can lead to disturbed insulin and glucagon release from islets, and may contribute to our findings. \n \nOur preliminary report highlights the potential that OGTT results can be erroneous in this population, and that CGM may be more accurate for patients to define their degree of glucose control. Large scale studies may shed light on the role of CGM in TM.", "authors": ["A. Choudhary", "P. Giardina", "Z. Antal", "M.

Painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) have been extremely well-studied over the last two centuries, and their mating system has been described as female choice based on male courtship display. The present study arises from observation that males seemingly have more protracted and serrated anterior marginal scutes than females. We hypothesized that the anterior carapace is sexually dimorphic, and that this morphology is a weapon used by males in coercive mating. We quantified anterior carapacial morphology using geometric morphometric analysis of digital photographs, drawing on samples of painted turtles from North American museum collections and our field site in Algonquin Provincial Park. We found that the anterior carapace of males had a significantly more serrated and projected shape compared to females, consistent with the sexual weapon hypothesis. Additionally, anterior carapacial shape was more strongly related to body size in males. Behavioural field observations strongly suggest that males use this morphology as a weapon to harm females during reproduction. The present study complements and strengthens the recent hypothesis that male painted turtles engage in coercion as an alternative reproductive tactic, questioning the long-understood paradigm of exclusive female choice in this well-studied species. Our study invites new avenues of research on the evolution of female harm in a system with extreme selection on female longevity and for which operational sex ratios vary among populations.

The role of photographs and image-making is intrinsic to these practices.

Words edited by J. Michael Lennon Taschen, 2012. 276pp. Cloth $69.99 In 1973, Norman Mailer published Marilyn, a biographical profile meant to be a twenty-thousand word piece, but which Mailer expanded to over one-hundred-thousand words after becoming deeply fascinated with Monroe during the writing process. The book, a bestseller that was released to a series of rave reviews, also featured a collection of pictures of Marilyn taken by a number of notable photographers, including Eve Arnold, Milton Greene, George Barris, and Bert Stern. Marilyn Monroe, an edited re-issue of Marilyn, might seem on the surface to be a pared down version of this initial publication, as it features an abridged version of Mailer's previous book (J. Michael Lennon, who edited Mailer's text, notes that he cut approximately twenty-thousand words from the earlier work) and includes only those photos shot by Stern in his now famous 1962 sitting with Monroe. The effect, however, is quite the opposite, with the final result invoking the sense that one is holding an enhanced rather than abbreviated version of the original. Such an effect largely occurs as a result of the ways in which Mailer's text amplifies the narrative suggested by Stern's photos. In his introduction to this new edition, Larry Schiller (who conceived the idea for the reissue), claims that Stern's are now the \"only\" photographs that can illuminate Mailer's text (19). While this may be overstating the case to some degree, the expansive collection of Stern's photographs does serve to complement Mailer's text in a unique way, achieving a unified effect that a varied collection of pictures by different photographers with different visions in different locations simply cannot match. Moreover, Stern's photos present an image of Marilyn seemingly more consistent with that fashioned by Mailer. That is, while many of Eve Arnold and Milton Green's photos in the original 1973 publication depict a more youthful and buoyant Marilyn, Stern's offer us something else--an older and more subdued Marilyn, beginning to show her age and signs of stress that the un-retouched photos are unable to hide. Likewise, while the chronological structure of Mailer's book suggests that he will trace Marilyn's gradual decline, Mailer's Marilyn always already seems on the verge of implosion--vulnerable, insecure, and struggling. In this way, the image of Marilyn that comes through in Stern's photographs seems to invoke that sense of fragile poise masking an inner turbulence that Mailer's text also suggests. This symbiotic relationship between Mailer's text and Stern's photographs also has much to do with each man's mission to find the essence of Marilyn, and their respective abilities to capture the complexity and nuance of character that often went overlooked during her lifetime. At the center of Mailer's work, specifically, is an obsession with the mystery surrounding Marilyn, from the strange coincidences that \"spring underfoot like toadstools\" throughout the duration of her life to the constant string of contradictions that define her personality (50). Part of this fascination likely arises from the various ways in which aspects of Mailer and Marilyn's lives overlapped. Like Marilyn, Mailer struggled with a controversial public image that threatened to overshadow his craft and at times led to misunderstandings and reductive assumptions about his personal character. It was, in fact, an awareness of this potential connection that led Larry Schiller to handpick Mailer to pen the original profile of Marilyn forty years ago, his rationale being that \"if you could get a writer who has been run over by a lot of trucks, like Marilyn was, and found a way to survive each time, like Marilyn did, it might reveal the key to this deeply mysterious woman\" (16). Yet as Mailer himself notes in his biography, the problem was not just that the \"real\" Marilyn became overshadowed by the public's perception of her, but that, perhaps, there never was a real Marilyn to begin with. \u2026", "authors": ["M.

During the last few months of MM\u2019s life she was prescribed a dozen different psychoactive drugs, mostly barbiturates, but also other hypnotic drugs and amphetamines. The major issues regarding her death include the time of death, the position of the body and the sincerity of the witnesses. Blood/ liver samples tested for pentobarbital and chloral hydrate showed lethal concentrations of both. Disturbingly enough, her doctor claimed he only prescribed pentobarbital and never chloral hydrate, which is not true. Drugs complicated the course of MM\u2019s insomnia and had a negative effect on her general health and behaviour, a situation seemingly ignored by the two different psychiatric diagnoses given to her by both doctors (\u201caddictive paranoid borderline personality\u201d, and \u201cmanic-depressive or bipolar personality\u201d). Barbiturates had been available for several decades at the time, and the issues of tolerance, dependency and accidental overdose had to be well known to them. On the other hand, MM thought she exercised a reasonable control on her drug intake, which along with a lack of a real medical control and the presence of spurious interests set the conditions for the advent of a grim outcome. Conclusion The treatment based on Freudian psychoanalysis and drugs failed to improve MM\u2019s condition and arguably worsened it. The very drugs prescribed to her to combat insomnia would eventually cause her death.", "authors": ["M.

Discussing the iconic photo of the burned and naked Vietnamese girl fleeing a U.S. napalm attack in On Photography (1977), Susan Sontag observed that \"images anaesthetize\" and create a confusion about reality that is \"analgesic morally as well as ... sensorially stimulating,\" suggesting the failure of viewers to feel properly, to experience the bodily pain often represented in the photograph. (2) Roland Barthes, writing about an exhibition of photographs of oppression during the Guatemalan revolution, finds the problem is that \"none of these photographs, all too skillful, touches us\"; \"someone has shuddered for us,\" making contact and feeling in our stead. (3) Likening atrocity photographs to pornography, which conversely involves too much feeling, suggests a similarly inapt bodily response. Our desirous consumption and circulation of atrocity images, as Sontag writes about the photographs of Abu Ghraib, is marked by the tropes of pornographic culture. (4) Indeed, in Regarding the Pain of Others (2003) Sontag holds that \"All images that display the violation of an attractive body are, to a certain degree, pornographic.\" (5) That our encounter with photographs of bodily violation may be unconsciously sexual is suggested by the appearance of shock photos on porn websites. If bodily feeling is the key connection between the anesthetic and pornographic effects of atrocity photographs, it is pivotal that the motif of iconic atrocity photographs is the assaulted body. John Taylor notes that \"bodies appear as a matter of routine in gruesome stories from overseas,\" and Barbie Zelizer's research uncovers how during catastrophes and conflicts more photographs appear in newspapers--photos that are larger and likely to show more of the body.6 The term \"pornography\" itself describes bodies in photographs and our relation to them, although, as with pornography itself, the connection is one of symbiotic supply and demand--not simple cause and effect. Sontag powerfully indicates and indicts a cultural context that remains mostly unconscious. In J.G. Ballard's postmodern dystopia of spectacle culture at its emergence, The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), napalm photographs from Vietnam appear on billboards alongside pictures of Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, exhibitions are held of war wounds, and images have the effect of \"sanctioning everything.\" William S. Burroughs comments in the novel's preface, \"Sexual arousal results from the repetition and impact of image.\"7 Photographs--of the image world (of the imaginary)--grab attention and appeal to our visual pleasure. As consumers, our viewpoint is disembodied--yet, as Barthes writes, the photograph has an embodied, haptic relationship to its referent. (8) The act of viewing photographs of any subject matter is an embodied experience, although rarely is that brought into the frame. Psychological research shows that \"pictures evoke emotions,\" that we are more likely to feel empathy for depictions of single bodies, and that we tend to mirror the affect represented \"in emotional contagion\"--a \"primitive, automatic\" response. (9) In Regarding the Pain of Others, Sontag is more skeptical about the power of photographs to make us feel connected or touched- -saying, ultimately, we cannot imagine other people's pain through photographs. The new technologies of war, visual pleasure, and atrocity exist in ever more addictive and dependent proximity: \"Newer technology provides a nonstop feed: as many images of disaster and atrocity as we can make time to look at.\" (10) The cell phones and other small digital cameras with which the Abu Ghraib photographs were taken and disseminated via the internet threatens to make us forget the body of the photograph and our propinquity to those in the photograph, and to make capturing and sharing subjects all too virtual. \u2026", "authors": ["Jay Prosser"], "citations": 1, "venue": "", "year": 2011}, "8": {"title": "Cyber Child Pornography Law and Technology Problems in Its Law Enforcement", "abstract": "Rapid grow of internet users as a result of widely open access significantly contributes to increasing criminal cases particularly child pornography.

Not wanting to deny the structural domination and day-to-day violence that most women experience, many feminists are equally preoccupied with acknowledging women\u2019s agency and recognizing their resistance. The feminist movement against domestic violence and sexual abuse, for example, has challenged the image of the passive battered woman. Speaking not of \u201cvictims\u201d but of \u201csurvivors,\u201d it has shifted attention to the multitude of ways in which women resist both male violence and its social legitimation (see Mahoney 1994; Schneider 2000, 74\u201386). It has thereby addressed problematic categories such as individual agency and argued for more historically grounded approaches that reflect how, in the process of responding to external social constraints, agency is in fact constructed by these very constraints (see Scott 1990). As such, the movement has helped feminism to disturb the paradigm of \u201cwoman as victim\u201d and of individualistic heroic action. The women\u2019s breast cancer movement is characterized by similar attempts to assess the patient\u2019s seemingly passive response to her illness.

It has affected each of us personally and professionally, as data from our six-month follow-up survey reveal: 45% of respondents reported knowing a friend, family member, or colleague who contracted COVID-19, 15% of respondents reported knowing someone who died of COVID-19, and 2% of respondents reported that they had contracted COVID-19 themselves. The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed our home and work lives in ways thought unimaginable scant months ago. It has transformed most of the practices of psychology. Psychology has transformed from in-office practice into a telepsychology-based profession. Its impact on our collective psyche will be felt for many years. We will continue to address the medium-term and longterm effects of COVID-19 for many years. COVID-19 has transformed from an acute problem (though it must still mostly be addressed as such) to a chronic one. Its effects will not go away, even after an effective vaccine has been developed. It behooves us to begin planning for what comes next. How do we effectively socialize children and adolescents when inperson contact is limited? How do we better mitigate the effects of enforced isolation on people with mental illness? In a society riven by political discord, how do we ensure that the voice of science is heard? As perverse as it may sound, most of us have experienced some positive effects of the virus-forced changes in our behavior. Unnecessary consumer consumption has been curbed. Indices of environmental quality are improving in many areas. A new focus on family togetherness and the value of interpersonal relationships has emerged. I, for one, will not miss the handshake as a socially obligated form of greeting, nor do I plan on boarding an airplane without a mask\u2014regardless of the availability of a vaccine. But the negative effects of the pandemic are staggering. The popular press reports that calls to national suicide hotlines are up. Reports of quasi-scientific national surveys of mental well-being suggest that as many as half of those surveyed are experiencing either negative psychological effects or the emergence of obvious mental symptoms as a result of the pandemic. The pandemic, combined with an attendant economic recession and a season filled with natural disasters likely accelerated by climate change (wildfires in the western US, hurricanes and flooding in the eastern US), have created a perfect storm of psychological stressors with which many have difficulty coping. More systematic investigations suggest an increase in adverse psychological responses, particularly among young adults, first responders, and some ethnic minorities. A Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, looking at data collected relatively early in the pandemic in June 2020, found substantial increases in anxiety and depression symptoms, and suicidal ideation rates double those observed in 2018 (Czeisler et al., 2020). We lead off this issue with the results of our recently completed second survey of psychologists\u2019 practices during the pandemic. In March 2020, we completed the first national survey of psychologists\u2019 practices at the beginning of the pandemic (Sammons, VandenBos&Martin, 2020a). That survey, initiated only one week after the United States had declared a public health emergency, was quickly followed by several other national surveys. In spite of differences in methodology, results of these surveys were strikingly similar: Psychologists had rapidly and overwhelmingly switched to telepsychology service provision, and they felt largely comfortable in their ability to do so. Early in the pandemic, practice caseloads had dropped for the majority of providers. Our earlier survey also indirectly suggested that patients had moderate levels of discomfort associated with the use of telepsychology. Our follow-up survey, almost six months later, found that the shift to telepsychology appears to have concretized (Sammons, VandenBos,Martin& Elchert, 2020b).Many providers anticipate that this will be a significant part of their service provision after a vaccine is available and the pandemic ends.

Residents are required to learn and apply volumes of complex information and to become proficient in clinical service delivery to meet the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competency requirements in psychiatry [1]. The information gleaned from didactic education, supervision, reading, observation, practicing, collaborative communication, and other education modalities facilitates building and refining a skillset that is a prerequisite for independent practice [2]. Unfortunately, the growing body of professional resources, including medical literature, makes it challenging, at best, to produce well-rounded physician/ scholars in an increasingly complex society. The psychiatry Residency Training Director is challenged with the task of crafting a training experience that treats education requirements equitably. She prioritizes training opportunities and refines the didactics curriculum and other educational modalities to offer residents a quality and balanced time-limited training experience that meets ACGME standards. This is an onerous task given the growing volume of available educational resources, clinical need, and related opportunities. Consequently, some sectors of required psychiatric education that may merit additional attention may be overlooked [1]. One such area involves training psychiatric residents to function as advocates for the profession and their patients. Residents can refine their communication skills by reaching out to and educating the public about mental health\u2014including emotional wellness, the mental health system, psychiatric assessment and treatment, destigmatizing mental illness, and access to care\u2014in greater detail than what is available in medical office brochures and public service announcements. One way to accomplish this involves empowering psychiatry residents to use critical thinking skills to identify lowcost, high-quality mental health educational materials that may appeal to the public. This requires residents to use a dispassionate, evidence-informed, and systematic approach to examining publicly accessible mental health resources. Though the Internet offers access to various forms of media, an Internet audio podcast program\u2014an episodic series of serial recordings that are accessible by downloading their digital files\u2014was used for the project because the recordings can be listened to on many types of electronic devices (computers, smartphones, tablets, MP3 players, automobile stereos, compact disk players, etc.), accessed in many settings, listened to while multitasking and replayed, or in some cases bookmarked, so that the user will be able to review specific segments if desired. Additionally, each podcast recording does not have to be consumed in one sitting. Residents were instructed to listen to several episodes of The Mind Deconstructed Podcast: Mental Health and Wellness with Dr. Kaz and George [3]. The Minnesotabased mental health education program is hosted by siblings Kaz Nelson, M.D., a psychiatrist and psychiatry Residency Training Director, and her brother, George, an attorney who works in child welfare. Their mission is to examine topics in psychiatry, including violence, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and mental health maintenance, in a manner that is user-friendly for non-healthcare professionals. Residents used set descriptors while explaining their impressions to their colleagues. The categories included accuracy of the information (evidence-informed), ease of comprehension (organized), language (absence of jargon), presentation style (approachable), length of recordings, and value of information for laypersons (Table 1). Although the free podcast was easily accessed and had good sound quality, these criteria also merit consideration (Table 1).

Williams eds., forthcoming 2021), asks into the likely implications of the Trump Presidency for the future sustainability of constitutional norms in the United States. It observes that what counts as a persuasive answer to that question turns primarily on why politicians\u2019 respect for constitutional norms has been declining, and it argues that President Donald Trump is more of an effect (and a symptom) than a cause of the decline. Specifically, he is more of an effect than a cause of larger racial and cultural changes in American society that are causing Republican voters and politicians to perceive an existential threat to their continued political and cultural power\u2014and, relatedly, to deny the legitimacy of their political opponents. As illustrated by the conduct of Republicans in Congress and statehouses, it is very unlikely that Republican politicians will respect constitutional norms when they deem so much to be at stake in each election and significant governmental decision. Moreover, Democratic politicians, when they regain full control of the political branches, may begin a campaign of retaliation that will include violations of norms. \n \nAs a result, one should expect continued violations of constitutional norms by American politicians to accomplish partisan goals\u2014what Mark Tushnet has called \u201cconstitutional hardball\u201d\u2014at least until the electoral impact of demographic changes in the electorate exceeds the electoral impact of the rural favoritism that is built into the nation\u2019s constitutional electoral processes. The Republican Party has likely been able to hold on to so much power without moderating for as long as it has primarily because of that rural favoritism. At the same time, the results of the 2020 elections indicate that the country is not nearly as liberal as the most liberal members of the Democratic Party may believe, so the party may remain under pressure to stay relatively moderate. Demography is not destiny, as the increase in Latino support for Trump in 2020 suggests, and the education-level divide may continue to play a significant role in party configurations in the years ahead. \n \nAt some point, however, the Republican Party may face a choice between losing most national elections and significantly broadening its appeal beyond racial, religious, cultural, and economic conservatives. Broadening the tent may again make it possible for the leaders of the Republican and Democratic Parties in the White House, Congress, and statehouses to sustain constitutional norms, but this time while sharing a commitment to racial equality. The sobering historical reality, discussed in this chapter, is that the leaders of the two parties have never been able to sustain norms and work together over a significant period of time when they have been divided over race. Put differently, the racial reckoning in the United States that continues to unfold as this chapter goes to press is likely responding in part to a history in which norm compliance and legislative cooperation among politicians in the two parties came largely at the expense of black people, who were not in \u201cthe room where it happened\u201d when fateful compromises were forged.", "authors": ["Neil S.

The various chapters deal with cases of misinformation propounded by politicians, journalists, and corporations. Research on issues of the environment, politics, and health are included as well as investigations of texts, images, and even satire. There is also a clear emphasis on the global significance of understanding and impeding the spread of misinformation in the mass media. This user-friendly book\u2019s sixteen chapters are organized into three parts: The book begins evaluating misinformation by conceptualizing and measuring audience awareness, goes on to look at theoretical effects and consequences, and then offers potential solutions and ideas for further research.

President Trump will go where no one has gone before. President Trump will upset every settled expectation. These are the reasons why now President Donald Trump won the presidency. He makes no bones about it. President Trump has challenged decades old policies and commitments including NATO, One China, the EU, and NAFTA, among many others. President Trump makes clear his distaste for the media. President Trump inserted \"fake news\" into the American lexicon. President Trump is going to build that $25 billion wall along the United States and Mexican border. President Trump is going to start a trillion-dollar trade war with Mexico to compel Mexico to pay for the wall. Expect a big price increase for burritos, which use avocados imported from Mexico. President Donald Trump became a public figure because he kick started the media into making him a public figure. As a truly self-made public figure and snaring the greatest prize in recorded history, President Donald Trump knows no bounds, which is the reason for this article. This article argues that President Trump deigns to control his image and his message at nearly any cost. President Trump can succeed if he can tamp down the cacophony of shrieks and howls that shadow him. Threatening someone with a defamation suit succeeds in dialing down this rhetoric and throwing off the media and online stalkers. Additionally, this article demonstrates that opening the federal courts to defamations suits, and Shady Grove tossing anti-Slapp, topples New York Times v. Sullivan. Like all articles that suggest a change of the law, overturn a decision, or rewrite the law legislation or regulation, the article is 100% speculative but predictive. Certainly, once in a very blue moon (or red), an article topples existing law. However, this article is different. Instead, this article reveals the law of President Trump's intended consequences. President Trump wants to expand the right to sue for defamation. What President Trump really wants is to dam the rising reservoir of rejection, ill will and repudiation that might crest his presidency. For instance, Alec Baldwin is on President's Trump's sue list. A viable right to sue gets the job done because few erstwhile defendants have the resources to defend themselves. Defamation cases, even against a public figure, rise from the grave when the anti-Slapp statutes are kicked to the courthouse curb. Is the banishment of anti-Slapp viable? Under the vaulted ceiling of Shady Grove, the answer lies in the ideological animus of the Republican and Hard Right Congress whose own ambitions likewise know no bounds. America is about to take a new [Hard Right] turn. Just ask Alec Baldwin who said \"Yes, this is real life . . . this is really happening . . . on January 20th, I, Donald J. Trump, will become the 45th president of the United States ... and then two months later, Mike Pence will become the 46th.\" [From Saturday Night Live, January 14, 2017, opening skit]. * David J.

The list includes erecting a wall on the border of Mexico, dissolving the Obama era sanctions imposed upon Russia, banning all Muslim immigrants by an Executive Order Redux, and tossing Obamacare. Although the list is endless and in progress, President Trump seeks the greater goal, which is to immunize him from any criticism, critique, rumor, innuendo or insult. President Trump pushes back from criticism, and verbally attacks all critics, including members of the new media (CNN \u2013 which he dubs a purveyor of \"fake news\"), Meryl Streep (\"overrated\"), and even the intelligence community for presenting rumors of illicit conduct (Nazi Germany). His weapon of mass humiliation is the 140-character Twitter feed that consumes all the media oxygen anywhere. What is #1 on President Trump's Wish List? Answer: \"One of the things I'm going to do if I win... I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,\" Trump said during a rally in Fort Worth, Texas. \"We're going to open up those libel laws so when The New York Times writes a hit piece, which is a total disgrace, or when the Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected,\" he said. \"We're going to open up libel laws and we're going to have people sue you like you've never got sued before.\" What is # 2 on President Trump's Wish List? Answer: \"Well in England they have a system where you can actually sue if someone says something wrong,\" Trump said. \"Our press is allowed to say whatever they want and get away with it. And I think we should go to a system where if they do something wrong \u2013 I'm a big believer, tremendous believer of the freedom of the press, nobody believes it stronger than me \u2013 but if they make terrible, terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people, and I'm not just talking about me, I'm talking about anybody else, then yes, I think you should have the ability to sue them.\" The Beacon of New York Times v.

No matter the deep shift to the Hard Right with one or more appointments to the Supreme Court in the next four to eight years, the Supreme Court is unlikely to overturn or shrink New York Times v. Sullivan. This body of law, on the books, will remain unchanged, no matter who sits in the White House or on the Supreme Court. This is the holding of New York Times v. Sullivan: \"[t]he constitutional guarantees require, we think, a federal rule that prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with \u2018actual malice\u2019\u2014 that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\" While this burden of proof is near Sisyphean, what stops the public official from the filing a lawsuit whose allegations contour to this holding? The answer is found under anti-Slapp statutes that enable the defendant to dismiss the action at the outset and without the burden or expense of endless litigation. For example, under California's robust anti-Slapp law, the defendant can move to strike the complaint if the complaint is based on constitutionally protected activity. If so, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the claim is viable, i.e., tenable. Given the broad sweep of New York Times v. Sullivan, the plaintiff would have to make out its prima facie case within nearly 30 days of the filing of the lawsuit. Thirty days is a very short period to demonstrate the probable validity of a defamation case. Anti-Slapp motions rid the court of suits that seek to chill, if not suppress, the exercise of constitutional rights for fear of expensive, harrowing and ruinous civil litigation. Chances are that the defendant wins, the complaint is dismissed, and the defendant collects significant attorney's fees, even if contingent upon the outcome of the case. Anti-Slapp litigation has no lack of takers given the mandatory fees awarded to the winning defendant. Anti-Slapp's are state statutes that find their way into federal courts. The current landscape of a libel suit follows down the path of the anti-Slapp statute that enables the defendant to end the litigation at the outset by forcing the plaintiff to put on a tenable case. Even if the defendant loses the anti-Slapp motion and faces the full frontal wrath of the angry plaintiff, the defendant enjoys the right of an immediate appeal. An anti-Slapp appeal stalls 5 N.Y.

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2018. 370p. $99.99 cloth, $29.99 paper.", "abstract": "During this age of purported voter apathy and citizen disengagement, Roderick P. Hart offers Civic Hope: How Ordinary Americans Keep Democracy Alive. In this book, Hart uses abundant evidence in the form of newspaper letters to the editor to demonstrate how a robust \u201cculture of argument\u201d (p. 10) sustains and nurtures democracy in the United States. Letters, Hart writes, evidence an ongoing willingness of people to call out imperfections in the nation\u2019s leaders and the nation\u2019s policies, while also debating ideas, in writing, with their neighbors. Hart draws his conclusions from a dataset that spans seven decades (1948\u20132018) and so runs the gamut from when newspapers were part of the daily artifice of many American doorsteps to the recent era of print decline and the rise of internet culture. Hart crafts his thesis around what he terms \u201ccivic hope,\u201d or the preternatural American ability to maintain faith in democratic ideals despite bleak odds. Such hope is more than optimism. It is a willingness of people to struggle with themselves and each other about the meaning of the nation in which they live and to push forward in the face of problems. By conducting a content analysis of 10,000 letters from newspapers in 12 midsize cities\u2014in addition to 10 surveys that happened over 20 years, as well as in-depth interviews with some letter writers and editors\u2014Hart provides insight into how people negotiate and clarify political values; expect their leaders and fellow citizens in the nation to act; and lament failures of behavior and action, publicly and permanently, in writing. By studying letters to the editor, Hart explains, scholars can apprehend the \u201ctexture of people\u2019s beliefs\u2014the reasons underlying their opinions and the varied ways in which a given belief can be expressed\u201d (p. 8; emphasis in original). Much of Hart\u2019s enthusiasm for studying letters derives from their source as grassroots evidence. The 12 cities from which he draws data are \u201cnothing special,\u201d he writes: they are not New York, San Francisco, or New Orleans (p. 22). Rather, they are places whose letters and writers are worthy of study precisely because they could be anywhere. Although those who write are almost never famous, they are important because they have composed at least one letter to the editor. This singular act elevates them beyond political cynicism. There is a kind of Tocquevillian nostalgia inherent in Hart\u2019s argument\u2014he admits as much himself (on p. 25)\u2014because he insists that citizenship is realized not only through voting but also through writing and speaking. This nostalgia extends to Hart\u2019s idealization of the printed word as the quintessential form of democratic debate. The book underexplores whether this idealization still holds in a twenty-first century, postTrump world. Hart also argues convincingly that letter writers act as citizen vanguards against disengagement and even disinformation. They keep the conversation going. However, recent studies make plain that the public is more likely than ever to believe in and act on falsehoods and lies. In later chapters, especially chapter 7, Hart suggests that even when letter writers get things wrong their contribution is still additive because they keep people thinking and conversing. However, as Yochai Benkler and Robert Faris recently wrote in Network Propaganda (2018), \u201cas a public we have lost our capacity to agree on shared modes of validation as to what is going on and what is just plain whacky\u201d (p. 6). Hart suggests that we can survive such wackiness so long as people keep writing. However, he never fully explains why this should be the case, except to celebrate how letters are the purview of ordinary people and reveal ordinary Americans\u2019 political ideas and anxieties. An indisputable strength of the book is Hart\u2019s use of breakout quotes from writers. The words give life to the manuscript, just as Hart argues that the letters he studies give vibrancy to US democracy. Readers move through time from commentary about Truman and Eisenhower to dyspeptic remarks about the character of Donald Trump. Such examples are grounded in extensive data analysis that includes digestible charts and bulleted lists that undergraduate readers may find helpful as they make their way through nearly 300 pages of text, not including appendices. Getting through so many pages is helped mightily by Hart\u2019s writing. His prose is engaging, authoritative, and scholarly all at the same time. Each chapter is well grounded in literature in political science and political communication. Hart nicely surveys what others have discovered about his questions and then uses his own letter data to color or trouble those conclusions. This tack works especially well in chapters 4\u20139, in which he wonders who writes letters, who reads them, what makes them compelling, and what makes them interesting, and more. Turning the stereotype of the crackpot curmudgeon on its head, Hart continually emphasizes the ordinary nature of those who compose letters, insisting that although they tend toward the earnest in personality, they make up for this with healthy doses of skepticism. Readers read letters for many reasons, including to learn and feel connected to the community.", "authors": ["Stephanie A.

President Trump has repeatedly cited his concerns over voter fraud associated with mail-in ballots as a reason that he may not abide by an adverse electoral outcome. Polling conducted in September 2020 suggests that nearly half of Republicans agree with the president that election fraud is a major concern associated with expanded mail-in voting during the pandemic. Few Democrats share that belief. Despite the consensus among independent academic and journalistic investigations that voter fraud is rare and extremely unlikely to determine a national election, tens of millions of Americans believe the opposite. This is a study of the disinformation campaign that led to widespread acceptance of this apparently false belief and to its partisan distribution pattern. Contrary to the focus of most contemporary work on disinformation, our findings suggest that this highly effective disinformation campaign, with potentially profound effects for both participation in and the legitimacy of the 2020 election, was an elite-driven, mass-media led process. Social media played only a secondary and supportive role.\r\n\r\nOur results are based on analyzing over fifty-five thousand online media stories, five million tweets, and seventy-five thousand posts on public Facebook pages garnering millions of engagements. They are consistent with our findings about the American political media ecosystem from 2015-2018, published in Network Propaganda , in which we found that Fox News and Donald Trump\u2019s own campaign were far more influential in spreading false beliefs than Russian trolls or Facebook clickbait artists. This dynamic appears to be even more pronounced in this election cycle, likely because Donald Trump\u2019s position as president and his leadership of the Republican Party allow him to operate directly through political and media elites, rather than relying on online media as he did when he sought to advance his then-still-insurgent positions in 2015 and the first half of 2016.\r\n\r\nOur findings here suggest that Donald Trump has perfected the art of harnessing mass media to disseminate and at times reinforce his disinformation campaign by using three core standard practices of professional journalism. These three are: elite institutional focus (if the President says it, it\u2019s news); headline seeking (if it bleeds, it leads); and balance , neutrality, or the avoidance of the appearance of taking a side. He uses the first two in combination to summon coverage at will, and has used them continuously to set the agenda surrounding mail-in voting through a combination of tweets, press conferences, and television interviews on Fox News. He relies on the latter professional practice to keep audiences that are not politically pre-committed and have relatively low political knowledge confused, because it limits the degree to which professional journalists in mass media organizations are willing or able to directly call the voter fraud frame disinformation. The president is, however, not acting alone. Throughout the first six months of the disinformation campaign, the Republican National Committee (RNC) and staff from the Trump campaign appear repeatedly and consistently on message at the same moments, suggesting an institutionalized rather than individual disinformation campaign. The efforts of the president and the Republican Party are supported by the right-wing media ecosystem, primarily Fox News and talk radio functioning in effect as a party press. These reinforce the message, provide the president a platform, and marginalize or attack those Republican leaders or any conservative media personalities who insist that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud associated with mail-in voting.\r\n\r\nThe primary cure for the elite-driven, mass media communicated information disorder we observe here is unlikely to be more fact checking on Facebook. Instead, it is likely to require more aggressive policing by traditional professional media, the Associated Press, the television networks, and local TV news editors of whether and how they cover Trump\u2019s propaganda efforts, and how they educate their audiences about the disinformation campaign the president and the Republican Party have waged.", "authors": ["Y.

They collected journal writings, songs written by migrant workers, and migrant poetry. They shot video, documented protests, and met with managers and governments officials. In twelve crisp and highly readable chapters, we are introduced to suicide survivor Tian Yu, to the history of Foxconn in Taiwan and its move into electronic manufacturing in China, to systems of labor discipline and techniques of worker monitoring and surveillance, and to stories, told in the workers\u2019 own words, of the disciplining of everyday life, on the clock and off.

His theoretical discussion is helpful, however, in discussing the limitations and some errors of Amy Zegart\u2019s 1999 Flawed by Design, which is among the most prominent discussions of intelligence in academic political science (pp. 42-43, 76, 79\u201380). For example, Durbin refutes Zegart\u2019s claim that the CIA was built primarily to serve parochial bureaucratic, not national, interests (p. 43); he finds instead that reformers constructed the CIA as a direct response to perceived national intelligence needs. Durbin\u2019s understanding of CIA history is generally good. He demonstrates considerable command of the scholarly literature on bureaucratic organizations and legislative reform of intelligence. But nearly absent are references to the three best journals on intelligence issues: the CIA\u2019s Studies in Intelligence, first published in 1955, and the more scholarly Intelligence and National Security and International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence, which date from the 1980s. These high-quality journals have markedly improved the literature on intelligence in recent years. Each has published much material relevant to Durbin\u2019s questions, as well as articles on many other aspects of intelligence. While his knowledge of the subject is good, Durbin makes a few questionable judgments and mistakes. For example, he attributes the demise in 1973 of the CIA\u2019s Office of National Estimates, which drafted national intelligence estimates (NIEs), to the fraying Cold War consensus of the time (p. 130); most students of CIA history believe instead that it reflected mounting unhappiness with the judgmental errors contained in NIEs in the 1960s and early 1970s, which were due largely to the declining abilities of estimators over the years as the CIA\u2019s leaders assigned lesser analysts to the Office. He attributes the writing of NIE 11-3/8-75 on Soviet strategic programs, which triggered the infamous Team A/Team B \u201ccompetitive analysis\u201d of Soviet strategic military capabilities and intentions of 1976, to the CIA (p. 130). In fact, by this time NIEs were coordinated assessments of the intelligence community as a whole. And he incorrectly reports current House intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes\u2019s name to beDavidNunes (p. 251). But given the complexity of the issues he discusses and the many subtle changes that occurred in intelligence institutions over time, Durbin\u2019s command of CIA history is impressive. The book\u2019s last chapter outlines an important and realistic research agenda. Persuasively warning that \u201c[s] tudents and practitioners of international relations ignore intelligence at their peril\u201d (p. 267), Durbin argues that intelligence is a variable in international relations, not a constant, and that its importance can be demonstrated in case studies. (The specialist intelligence literature has done some such work.) He notes that the study of intelligence reform is a useful adjunct to the study of bureaucratic processes in general (pp. 270\u201371), and he accurately observes that his book lightly treats the goals and interests of intelligence services themselves (p. 267). To Durbin\u2019s research agenda might be added a consideration of why intelligence reform proposals so often reflect retread, failed ideas that have little or no chance of improving intelligence performance, and why reformers seem unable to craft reform proposals that generate institutional incentives that make intelligence professionals want to implement them. And the stunning, unprecedented public display since 2016 of partisanship by current and former intelligence officers, most prominently demonstrated by former director of the CIA John Brennan\u2019s verbal attacks on President Donald Trump, suggests new questions about the partisanship of the intelligence bureaucracy, the possibility of new varieties of politicization within U.S. intelligence agencies, and the evolving nature of the CIA\u2019s organizational interests. For intelligence practitioners, Durbin offers one of the best academic treatments of intelligence agencies\u2019 dealings with reformers in intelligence oversight roles. The CIA and the Politics of US Intelligence Reform effectively presents the ways in which many academics and congressional reformers of intelligence, especially, see the business\u2014important knowledge for intelligence professionals as well as a wide scholarly audience increasingly interested in these issues.", "authors": ["Surupa Gupta"], "citations": 9, "venue": "Perspectives on Politics", "year": 2018}, "9": {"title": "A Left Feminist Comment on Supporting Hillary Clinton", "abstract": "Very little in my adult life has made me feel my feminism so strongly as the 2016 defeat of Hillary Rodham Clinton.

This system determines the area under the curve (AUC) of the drug by pharmacokinetic modeling and Bayesian estimation. The purpose of this study was to analyze tacrolimus exposure after administration of its modified-release formulation (Advagraf) in kidney allograft recipients, to optimize its therapeutic drug monitoring. Methods: This is a retrospective study of exposure indices measured locally [trough tacrolimus concentration (C0), C0/dose] or estimated through ISBA (AUC, AUC/dose, AUC/C0), of their evolution over posttransplantation time, and of the correlations between them. Results: A total of 922 requests posted by 28 different centers for routine Advagraf adjustment in 530 different patients treated with Advagraf were studied. The exposure to, and dose requirement of, tacrolimus significantly increased across the first posttransplant months before reaching steady state. The AUC:C0 ratio (on which C0 monitoring is implicitly based) was stable across the different posttransplant periods, although with high interindividual variability.

However, little is known about the relationships between various cannabis practices and illicit drug use/prescription drug misuse among young adult cannabis users with and without legal access to medical cannabis.\n\n\nMETHODS\n210 MCP and 156 non-patient cannabis users (NPU) aged 18-26 were recruited in Los Angeles in 2014-15 for a longitudinal study assessing the impact of medical cannabis on health and substance use among emerging adults. For the present analysis, only quantitative baseline survey data were used. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between past 90-day cannabis practices and other drug use, including illicit drug use and prescription drug misuse.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIllicit drug use was associated with being non-Hispanic white (AOR\u2009=\u20093.0, 95% CI 1.8-5.1), use of cannabis concentrates (AOR\u2009=\u20092.8, 95% CI 1.6-4.9), while self-reported medical cannabis use was associated with lower probability of illicit drug use (AOR\u2009=\u20090.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9).

The proportions of patients experiencing an ADR were compared by assessing the percentage of patients, treated with either ADA or ETN, experiencing at least one ADR during their first time treatment. Survival to first ADR and drug survival were assessed by calculating time between start of treatment and first ADR and start of treatment and discontinuation of treatment respectively. Stop and restart of treatment within 90 days was considered as continuous use. Differences in proportions were statistically tested using Fisher\u2019s Exact Test. Differences in drug survival between ADA and ETN were tested by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Log Rank tests.A total of 422 patients were included in this study (ADA 259, ETN 163).

In 5-10% of AML cases, specific KMT2A gene perturbations can occur which result in an aggressive and poor prognostic group of blood cancers. The KMT2A complex also appears to play a central role in the epigenetic dysregulation in AMLs with co-mutations such as NPM1, IDH1/2, EZH2, and DNMT3A. Therefore, there is strong rationale for targeting these AML subsets which may be exquisitely sensitive to inhibition of the menin-KMT2A chromatin complex.\n KO-539 is a novel, once daily, oral investigational drug candidate targeting the menin-KMT2A protein-protein interaction.\n KOMET-001 (NCT04067336) is an ongoing Phase 1/2A open-label study evaluating KO-539 in adult patients (pts) with relapsed and/or refractory AML agnostic to oncogenic mutational type. The Phase 1 dose-escalation objectives are to assess safety and tolerability, characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK), and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose. The Phase 2A dose expansion portion will assess anti-leukemic activity, PK, safety and tolerability in select genetic subtypes of AML. Preclinically, the drug is shown to be highly protein bound (>99%) across animal species. Using physiologically-based PK (PBPK) modeling, the estimated human efficacious dose was estimated to be 600 mg po qd.\n As of data cutoff on August 10, 2020, 6 pts with relapsed and/or refractory AML have been enrolled in the trial. Dose escalation began with single pt cohorts at 50 mg po qd in 28 day cycles and has proceeded through to 200 mg dosing cohorts. An expansion of 3 pts at 200 mg was initiated to better characterize the PK and exposure of KO-539.\n To date, 3 enrolled pts have been studied for safety and have not experienced any dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within the 28 day DLT-assessment window. Grade 3 (G3) or higher drug related adverse events have included G3 tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) at 50 mg and a G3 embolic event at 100 mg. KO-539 has been well tolerated with no dose interruptions or discontinuations due to drug related adverse events. There were no treatment-related deaths, and two pts discontinued treatment due to disease progression. Peak drug concentrations were attained between 2-3 hours after daily oral dosing with an elimination half-life of greater than 24 hours.\n KO-539 has demonstrated evidence of biologic activity in pts in the first 3 dose levels treated to date. The 50 mg pt with a KMT2A-r and the 200 mg pt with a p53 mutation and PICALM-AF10 fusion exhibited evidence of tumor lysis syndrome and markedly decreased hydroxyurea requirements with blood count stabilization, respectively. A third pt (100 mg dose level) with SETD2 and RUNX1 co-mutations achieved a complete remission with confirmed negative MRD by flow cytometry after two cycles of therapy and continues on treatment. The biologic activity of KO-539 at lower doses may be explained by inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme by concomitantly administered azole antifungals. KO-539 is metabolized into at least two metabolites with comparable activity to KO-539; total drug concentrations (i.e., KO-539 plus active metabolites) exhibited a dose-dependent increase.\n Although KO-539 is a CYP3A4 substrate, preclinical data suggest both KO-539 and its metabolites act as inhibitors, potentially providing an advantage in overcoming drug resistance attributable to CYP3A4 metabolism by bone marrow stroma. The physiology of the bone marrow sinusoids also allows both unbound and protein-bound drug to reach the sites of leukemic involvement. The high level of protein binding may therefore provide an opportunity for organ-specific targeted action while possibly limiting off target effects. The potential advantage associated with the CYP3A4 inhibitory characteristics of KO-539 to overcome drug-resistance in the bone marrow stroma also continues to be investigated.\n In conclusion, the early biologic activity of KO-539 in relapsed AML is encouraging, and its unique PK characteristics may be advantageous for clinical benefit. In addition to the above, any updated safety, PK, and efficacy data will be presented at the time of the conference.\n \n \n Wang: Abbvie: Consultancy; Jazz Pharmaceuticals: Consultancy; Bristol Meyers Squibb (Celgene): Consultancy; Genentech: Consultancy; Pfizer: Speakers Bureau; Stemline: Speakers Bureau; PTC Therapeutics: Consultancy; Macrogenics: Consultancy; Astellas: Consultancy.

Safety analyses included the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), severe AEs, AEs of special interest (AESI), and mortality of BEL (all doses and formulations combined) vs PBO at Week 52.The pooled analysis included 4170 patients. Overall, 81.0% (n=2280/2815) of patients receiving BEL and 76.6% (n=1038/1355) of patients receiving PBO completed their respectively enrolled study; the most common reason for withdrawal was occurrence of an AE in both groups. The majority of patients were female (BEL: 94.5%; PBO: 93.6%), the mean age in both groups was 38 years, and baseline characteristics (race, SLE duration, disease activity, SLE damage, complement levels, anti-dsDNA binding, SLE medication usage) were similar between treatments.The incidence of patients experiencing \u22651 AE, \u22651 SAE, and mortality was similar across treatments (Table 1); the most commonly reported SAEs in both groups were infections and infestations (BEL: 5.4% [n=151/2815]; PBO: 5.9% [n=80/1355]).

The need for dose adjustment following bariatric surgery was examined, as well as the potential for extrapolation to other drugs subjected to coinciding pharmacokinetic mechanisms.

In the case of the majority of studied drugs, an increased absorption rate was observed early after RYGBP. The effect on systemic exposure allows for a low degree of extrapolation, including between drugs subjected to the same major metabolic and transporter pathways. On the basis of current understanding, predicting the pharmacokinetic change for a specific drug following RYGBP is challenging.

However, the mechanisms of injury protection provided by the ankle braces in the basketball game are still unknown. Objectives: To analyze the effects of wearing a lace-up ankle brace, and to conduct an exercise protocol that simulated the intensity of the basketball game on ground reaction force (GRF) during basketball-specific vertical jumps. Methods: Eleven male younger basketball players aged under 18 completed 48 vertical jumps, with and without ankle braces, during an exercise protocol composed of four 10-minute periods, simulating the activity profile and intensity of the basketball game as well as the typical intervals between periods. Mediolateral (variables: the greatest medial and lateral peaks) and vertical (variables: vertical peak, impulse peak, impulse at 50 ms of landing, loading rate and jump height) GRF were measured during takeoff and landing for all the jumps performed in the exercise protocol. Results: The use of the ankle brace reduced mediolateral GRF in all periods of the exercise protocol during takeoff and landing ( P < 0.05), without affecting the vertical GRF ( P > 0.05). Mediolateral and vertical GRF (takeoff mediolateral vertical peaks, landing mediolateral peaks, landing impulse peak, takeoff and landing loading rate) increased significantly during four subsequent 10-minute periods ( P < 0.05). However, for mediolateral GRF, the increase overtime was higher without braces. Conclusions: The use of the ankle brace reduced the mediolateral GRF on the lower limb, while there was a progressive increase in the external load applied to the body during the vertical jumps in the subsequent periods of the exercise protocol performed at the same intensity of the basketball game.

Foot orthoses are commonly used to support the deformed foot arch, and improve normal foot function. However, it is unclear if foot orthoses use affects jump performance in athletes. Our study aims to investigate if foot type and/or foot orthosis influence countermovement jump (CMJ) and standing broad jump (SBJ) performance and lower limb biomechanics.MethodsTwenty-six male basketball players were classified into normal-arched (n\u2009=\u200915) or flat-footed (n\u2009=\u200911) groups using the Chippaux-Smirak index, navicular drop test, and the resting calcaneal angle measurement. They performed jumps with and without prefabricated foot orthoses. We measured jump height and distance for CMJ and SBJ, respectively. Hip, knee and ankle joint angles, angular velocities, moments and powers during take-off were also measured.ResultsFor CMJ, the flat-footed group exhibited less ankle plantarflexion (F1,24\u2009=\u20098.407, p\u2009=\u20090.008, \u03b7p2\u2009=\u20090.259 large effect) and less hip joint power (F1,24\u2009=\u20097.416, p\u2009=\u20090.012, \u03b7p2\u2009=\u20090.244 large effect) than the normal-arched group. Foot orthoses reduced ankle eversion in both groups (F1,24\u2009=\u20096.702, p\u2009=\u20090.016, \u03b7p2\u2009=\u20090.218 large effect). For SBJ, the flat-footed group produced lower peak hip angular velocity (F1,24\u2009=\u20097.115, p\u2009=\u20090.013, \u03b7p2\u2009=\u20090.229 large effect) and generated lower horizontal GRF (F1,24\u2009=\u20095.594, p\u2009=\u20090.026, \u03b7p2\u2009=\u20090.189 large effect) than the normal-arched group.

Compared to the normal-arched individuals, flat-footed athletes generated smaller propulsion GRF and lower hip flexion velocity and power, which suggests possible compensatory movement strategies to maximise jump performance. Future studies may investigate whether these altered biomechanics, taking into consideration their respective magnitude and effect sizes, may have implications on lower limb injuries. The use of foot orthoses resulted in biomechanical changes in both the normal-arched and flat-footed groups but does not enhance jumping performance.", "authors": ["M. Ho", "P. Kong", "L. Chong", "W.

Those observed in-situ on the active 2012 lava dome of Volcan de Colima range from voids with intra-clasts showing little movement and interpreted to be failure-nuclei, to sub-parallel lenses of sintered granular aggregate interpreted as fragmentation horizons, through to infilled fractures with evidence of viscous remobilization. All tuffisites show evidence of sintering. Further examination of the complex fracture-and-channel patterns reveals viscous backfill by surrounding magma, suggesting that lava fragmentation was followed by stress relaxation and continued viscous deformation as the tuffisites formed. The natural tuffisites are more permeable than the host andesite, and have a wide range of porosity and permeability compared to a narrower window for the host rock, and gauging from their significant distribution across the dome, we posit that the tuffisite veins may act as important outgassing pathways. To investigate tuffisite formation we crushed and sieved andesite from the lava dome and sintered it at magmatic temperatures for different times. We then assessed the healing and sealing ability by measuring porosity and permeability, showing that sintering reduces both over time. During sintering the porosity-permeability reduction occurs due to the formation of viscous necks between adjacent grains, a process described by the neck-formation model of Frenkel (1945). This process leads the granular starting material to a porosity-permeability regime anticipated for effusive lavas, and which describes the natural host lava as well as the most impervious of natural tuffisites. This suggests that tuffisite formation at Volcan de Colima constructed a permeable network that enabled gas to bleed passively from the magma. We postulate that this progressively reduced the lava dome\u2019s ability to seal and build pressure that drives explosions. Indeed, the time interval between explosions during 2007 to 2011 gradually increased before the onset of a period of quiescence starting in June 2011.

The influence of meteorology and climate change on plant phenology include shifts in the timing of the pollination seasons or an increase of the pollen production of different plants. \nThe present study explores the role of meteorological variability in the pollen dynamics. The main standardized pollen parameters (Annual Pollen Integral (APIn), Start, End and Length of the main pollen season) of 22 taxa collected by the Xarxa Aerobiologica de Catalunya (XAC) at 6 stations in Catalonia (Barcelona (BCN), Bellaterra (BTU), Girona (GIC), Lleida (LLE), Manresa (MAN) and Tarragona (TAU)) during the 18-year period from 1994 to 2011, have been considered. \nCorrelations between precipitation, insolation and temperature and the main pollen parameters have been investigated. The results obtained report the synchronism registered in the variations of pollen concentration with precipitation (negative), insolation (positive) and temperature (positive). Temperature was the meteorological variable that showed a greater influence in the pollen production and the timing of the pollen season, being insolation the least one. The Start of the main pollen season was the pollen parameter more correlated with the meteorological variables, especially with winter temperatures. \nThe influence of the climate variability associated with Northern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns (North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation and Western Mediterranean Oscillation) over the main pollen parameters has been also investigated. For most of the taxa, positive phases of the 3 climatic indices were related to a decrease in the APIn and an advance and enlargement of the main pollen season. Furthermore, negative phases of the climatic indices were linked to higher pollen production via an increase in rainfall. \nIn order to study the effect of local winds, 12 pollen types with sources are situated near the stations were considered. It was found that a positive correlation, thus an increase of pollen concentration, exists when the wind blows towards the station from the direction of the source location, and negative correlation, meaning dispersion and cleaning processes, results when the wind blows in a direction from the station towards the source of pollen or coming from the sea. This study could also be useful not only to identify and locate airborne pollen sources but to detect changes in land uses near the sampling stations.The cleaning and dispersion effect over the pollen concentrations has been observed over the coastal stations (BCN, BTU and TAU) mainly due to the wind induced by the sea breeze effect, and over the inland stations (LLE and MAN) when westerly frontal synoptic situations are produced. \nTwo forecasting models were used to predict the Start of the main pollen season. The first method consists on the cumulative sum of the daily average temperature. The second method consists on a multiple regression using rainfall and temperatures. These two models were tested by computing the discrepancy between the predicted and the observed values by means of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE ranged from 0.7 days for Pistacia in Manresa, up to 10 days for other taxa and stations. Platanus was the taxon showing the best results for all the stations. \nLong-range atmospheric transport of pollen over Catalonia has been also investigated, applying the source-receptor model to estimate the source areas of 6 pollen taxa that, not being very abundant in the territory, episodically present high values and hence are susceptible to come from distant sources. Apart from the great scientific interest that lies in the modelling of the source areas, the use of these models can be useful to biologists and allergists in the study and treatment of problems such as respiratory allergies.", "authors": ["Husam T.

This is an unprecedented event in human history, since the last reversal of the Earth's magnetic field occurred 41,000 years ago. Is a magnetic reversal a danger? No, it is the wondrous opportunity to realize what Life is and, as a consequence, what human consciousness is, to finally discover and use our inner abilities for participating in the new era. The solar wind is very fast plasma that escapes from the Sun\u2019s surface and spreads throughout the solar system with a spiral that touches the Earth\u2019s soil at 3:30 in the night, when the hormonal secretion of all us, humans, occurs. This daily meeting involves humans\u2019 physiology and the three terrestrial, solar and interplanetary magnetic fields into which we are all imbedded, in particular the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) carried by the solar wind (Fig. 1). These three reverse their North-South respective polarities with various rhythms. \u2022 The IMF has the fastest reversals (few minutes). \u2022 The solar magnetic field usually reverses its polarity every 11 years. \u2022 The Earth\u2019s one, or geomagnetic field, has very irregular reversals. The latest one occurred 41.000 and lasted about 450 years. The geomagnetic field is fading at accelerate rates and reconnecting with the other two solar and interplanetary magnetic fields. \u201cThe Force awakens\u201d according to the Star Wars Saga. It is not only science fiction for the humans who either awaken at 3:30 in the night or anyway feel that there is something new in the \u201cair\u201d. This \u201cair\u201d can be the secret relation between all Fig. 1. the Earth\u2019s magnetosphereThe solar wind penetrat es the spins, that compose our human body, and the three magnetic fields, which are re-connecting and re-composing their own rhythms. The \u201cair\u201d can also be the widespread feeling that an epochal change is occurring, maybe the announced end of times that actually is the beginning of the new rhythms of the entire solar system. These can have deep effects on every single body, change its \u201csecret\u201d relations with the \u201cunknown\u201d universal Force that trasmits spins. The Force is known instead, revealed in 1973 and called with a name, \u201celectroweak\u201d, that hides Its main function: cosmic oneness. 1 The motions of the solar wind are visible at https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/mag-portals.html 2 It is known as \u201cLaschamp event\u201d that curiously coincides with the disappearance of the Neanderthal. 3 See on Youtube my video: Organic Universe and human evolution.

Laniakea is a Hawaiian word that means \u201cimmense heaven\u201d; it instantly joins the speeds of the galactic nuclei, which are billion light-years distant, showing their coherent dance. Follow-up studies have clearly proved that Laniakea is not gravitationally bound. This is one of the many clues that gravity is not a Fig. 2 \u2013 The supercluster Laniakea is home to 100,000 galaxies universal force, as most people are \u201ceducated\u201d to instantly linked to each other by a Cosmic Web beyond spacetime. believe. Other clues regard the Earth (Fig. 8) and many other phenomena such as: (1) the solar wind that escapes from the presumed \u201cstrong\u201d gravity of the Sun. (2) The Earth\u2019s Crystalline Core that rotates independently from the rest of the Earth (Fig. 8). (3) The accelerating expansion of the Universe, awarded with the Nobel Prize, in 2011. (4) The tested and re-tested independence of the Standard Model of physics from gravity. This is the set of 24 particles and 24 antiparticles that can compose all the existing bodies of the Universe, the human ones included, and can easily communicate with the almost \u201cunknown\u201d electroweak Force (Fig. 6). (5) Why do 100,000 galaxies, billions of light-year distant from each other, dance together and humans fight against each other? (6) Because we are afflicted by a huge blindness that regards our human sight and the scientific one too (Fig. 3). This regards 95% of the universal mass dark matter (25%) and dark energy (70%) \u2013 according to the orthodox scientific theories. Most scientists now agree that dark energy pullulates from \u201cvacuum\u201d that is not emptiness, as we formerly believed. \u201cVacuum\u201d actually fluctuates, buzzes with particle-antiparticle couples that are popping in and out of the \u201cexistence\u201d that allows our human observations. Up to a few decades ago, these couples were only evident in the high-energy accelerators. Since 1994 another news: space probes have observed Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGF\u2019s) in our atmosphere and, in 2009, the Fermi Gamma Ray Telescope in Earth Orbit, observed intense gamma rays burst that produced about 100 trillion positrons, i.e. antielectrons. Such a huge quantity of anti particles had never been previously observed; it is another clue that \u201csomething new is in the air\u201d: it is antimatter in our atmosphere in this case. (7) Poorly understood TGF\u2019s \u2013 also indicated as \u201cDark Lightnings\u201d may often precede Lightning Strikes. Researchers have actually identified a \u201cdark lightning\u201d preceding a visible lightning of a few milliseconds. This finding provided observational evidence that the two phenomena, dark and luminous lightnings, are connected; it could open the \u201cdoors\u201d to a nearby future that coexists with our present (Fig. 4). Which kind of \u201cdoors\u201d? Probably spacetime singularities, the large ones, hidden into the nuclei of the giant galaxies and, also, the very minute ones, hidden into the atomic nuclei that compose all the observable bodies. Fig. 3 \u2013 According to scientific theories, 95% of the universal mass is not observed. III.

Theories calculate their existence ans so show the possible existence of many universes, which are in the future respect to our present. These show the mathematical possibility to jump in the future, to transit from our present \u201creality\u201d to a new one. It is not just science fiction. Spinning black and white holes are like the two extremes of one same coaxial \u201ccable\u201d: the black ones absorb matter and emit information, while the white ones do vice versa, emit matter and absorb information. Astronomers have recognized many black holes in the sky linked to the Cosmic Web (Fig. 3), but not yet white ones. What if our endocrine glads where white holes? (Fig. 5) We could be the intelligent terminal of the Cosmic Web which instantly transmit motions, for us emotions or hormones that affect our humors and emerge from our minute endocrine glands, exactly when the solar wind touches the Earth's surface. Hormones are the clues of the daily bread that can affect our humors and the physiology of our body, ultimately composed of particles that rotate, i.e. have spins and/or angular momenta in technical terms. Rotation is the key motion that links every single body to all the magnetic fields. Furthermore our hormonal secretion is linked to the Earth\u2019s rotation and also to the Sun\u2019s one (Fig. 5). At present the Earth\u2019s rotation is slowing down. Most scientists believe that this observed fact is imperceptible for us humans. Yet there are many people who feel it, simply because whatever Fig. 4 \u2013 The Penrose diagram shows the rotation is linked to magnetic fields which, on their turn, affect all the spins, coexistence of many universes and the hence the motions of all the fluids, within and without our bodies. These Rosen-Einstein bridges, that allow the motions involve our three fluids: the red blood and the lymph or white transit from one to another universe. blood, the cerebro spinal fluid that moves inside our vertebral column and our brain. This last fluid is often blocked by our cerebellum, responsible for primary functions such as temporality and sexuality. Common human behaviours actually oscillate between the \u201chigher\u201d, rational abilities of our grey matter and the \u201clow\u201d instinct of the cerebellum, also indicated as the \u201creptilian brain\u201d. What is time? Time is the effect of any cyclic motion. The Earth has many cyclic motions. For instance the diurnal rotation generates the duration of our day which is lengthening, while the Earth\u2019s annual rotation generates the duration of our year. Since there are many cycles in every body, there many times that we are now able to recongnize and so realize that their rhythms are all changing. These range from the fastest ones, now evident in TGF\u2019s and also in biological processes such as the folding of proteins into human bodies. The wonder is that all the natural rhythms have been composed in one, Eternal Harmony that artists and musicians, sages and poets have always felt and expressed in Fig. 5 The solar wind is very fast, very wide and weak. The three fluids, that circulate into our bodies, have different relations with all the three magnetic fields into which our bodies are imbedded. various ways. Who or what is Its Author?

Desert mistletoe, Phoradendron californicum (Viscaceae), is a dioecious parasitic plant that grows on woody legumes in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts, produces minute flowers during winter, and is dispersed by birds defecating fruits. Pollination of desert mistletoe has not been examined despite the species' reliance on insects for transporting pollen from male to female plants. I investigated the pollination of P. californicum parasitizing Acacia greggii (Fabaceae) shrubs at 3 sites at different elevations in the Mojave Desert of southern Nevada during February 2015. I examined pollen from male flowers, aspirated insects landing on female flowers, and counted pollen grains in insect pollen loads. Desert mistletoe's tricolpate pollen differed from a previous description by being oblate instead of subprolate in equatorial view. Female flowers were visited by 13 species of Diptera in 10 genera and 6 families and 3 species of Hymenoptera in 3 families. Almost all (98.5%) of the pollen carried by insects was from desert mistletoe. Five species of phytophagous fruit flies in Tephritidae were frequently found on flowers, comprising 53% of the insects collected, but carried low amounts of P. californicum pollen. Two species of blow flies in Calliphoridae, both larval decomposers of animals, were also relatively abundant on flowers and carried moderate to high pollen loads. Flies in Syrphidae, 2 predators and 1 plant-decomposer, carried varying amounts of conspecific pollen. Conspecific pollen loads also varied on a species of native bee in Halictidae and on naturalized honey bees in Apidae. Desert mistletoe appears to be pollinated mostly by tephritids, due to their abundance on female flowers, and by calliphorids. Blow flies would be more likely than fruit flies to carry pollen between male and female plants on different host shrubs due to their larger size and stronger flight. Parasitic, dioecious P. californicum plants appear to rely on a web of mutualism between fruit-eating birds and flower-fertilizing insects.", "authors": ["W.

We have developed a quantitative model for the interaction of a dusty ionized flow with nearby (massive) stars where radiation pressure stalls dust, piling it up at an appreciable distance (>0.1 pc), and force it to flow around the star. The model demonstrates that for the conditions in IC 434, the gas will decouple from the dust and will keep its original flow lines. Hence, we argue that this dust structure is the first example of a dust wave created by a massive star moving through the interstellar medium.

The results show that for late O-type stars with weak stellar winds, the stand-o distance of the resulting bow shock is very close to the star, well within the location of the dust wave. In general, we conclude that dust waves and bow waves should be common around stars showing the weak-wind phenomenon, i.e., stars with log(L=L ) < 5.2, and that these structures are best observed at mid-IR to FIR wavelengths, depending on the stellar spectral type.

In addition, higher temperatures are changing the timing and duration of the pollen season. As regional climates change, plants can move into new areas and changes in atmospheric circulation can blow pollen- and spore-containing dust to new areas, thus introducing people to allergens to which they have not been exposed previously. Climate change also influences the concentrations of airborne pollutants, which alone, and in conjunction with aeroallergens, can exacerbate asthma or other respiratory illnesses. The few epidemiological analyses of meteorological factors, aeroallergens, and allergic diseases demonstrate the pathways through which climate can exert its influence on aeroallergens and allergic diseases.

These loess records, which are disconnected from the North European Loess Belt (NELB), are of significant interest to document the evolution of perimediterranean landscapes and environments during the Last Glacial. To overcome the poor precision of available aeolian distribution maps, aeolian deposits were mapped using the topsoil textural database provided by the Land Use and Cover Area frame Statistical Survey project (LUCAS). The grain-size distribution of aeolian sand and loess was first determined using 116 samples taken from surveyed outcrops. Then, the areas showing a similar grain-size composition were extracted from the LUCAS rasters. The resulting map reproduces the conventional maps correctly but suggests a more significant extension of loess, in better agreement with the known distribution of outcrops. The map shows that the distinctive morphology of the valley dominantly controls the distribution of aeolian deposits. The deflation-related landforms, i.e., yardangs, closed depressions (pans), and desert pavements, are widespread south of narrowings of the Rhone Valley between latitudes 44\u00b0N and 45\u00b0N. They indicate palaeowinds blowing from the north/northwest. Aeolian sand, loessic sand, sandy loess, and loess deposits successively spread on both sides of the Rhone River. The loess is characterized by a coarse texture (main mode around 60\u202f\u03bcm), strong local thickness (>5\u202fm), limited extension, and abundant bioturbation.

These analyses did not include data from North America as flash glucose monitoring became available in late 2017. The objective of this follow-up analysis is to focus on real world outcomes in patients using flash glucose monitoring in Canada. A server collected anonymized data from patients whose flash glucose readers are uploaded (by patient or health care professional). Data from patients within Canada was analyzed through September 2018 (approximately 1 year). To understand the relationship between time in range and glucose variability with monitoring frequency, individuals were divided into 10 equal sized groups based on scanning frequency. Average \u00b1 SE time in range (glucose 70 mg/dL - 180 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L - 10.0 mmol/L]) and time in glucose \u2264 54 mg/dL (\u223c3.0 mmol/L) was calculated for each group. This analysis includes 15,424 readers, 95,103 sensors, and 108 million glucose measurements with an average of 12 scans per day.

Real-world data from Canada demonstrates that higher frequency of scanning is associated with increased time in range and decreased hypoglycemia.

The workshop back then aimed at putting the initial seeds for a new research community that collects experts in CAD with a special focus on machine learning (ML) from both industrial as well as academic fields. The workshop later turned into a regular workshop sponsored by IEEE and ACM called MLCAD: http://mlcad.itec.kit.edu, and the first edition was held in September 2019 in Canada. Advances in ML over the past half-dozen years promise to revolutionize the effectiveness of ML in a large variety of domains. However, design processes present challenges that require parallel advances in ML and CAD as compared to traditional ML applications such as image classification. CAD in this context is broadly defined as design-time techniques as well as run-time techniques. In this context, this special issue on ML for CAD focuses on introducing, exploring, and investigating the current as well as future challenges and opportunities when ML and CAD come together. One of the key goals of this special issue is to offer the readers, who are not specialists in ML or may not even have a specific background, a new perspective of the varied ongoing efforts in research that aim at employing ML techniques and algorithms, evolved over decades, in supporting CAD tools. Another goal is to demonstrate to readers how bringing ML and CAD together can open new doors in research toward increasing the efficiency of computing through advanced ML. This holds for both chip design as well as run-time management techniques. In particular, the special issue covers various abstraction layers. It demonstrates how ML does enrich both design-time as well as run-time CAD methodologies to significantly improve their effectiveness. In this special issue, we have 12 interesting articles coving a wide range of different CAD areas.

Gracing the front is the image of a special operations soldier with parachute in full bloom, slightly above a treeline, with a snow-capped mountain in the distance. Exactly what the paratrooper will encounter on the ground is not clear. It is a clever visual representation of the challenge of intervention and the purpose of this volume. Elusive Pursuits serves as a comparative evaluation of Canadian interventions in the post-Cold War era, a period that saw Canada in (or above) Afghanistan, Bosnia, East Timor, Haiti, Kosovo, Libya, Somalia, and at present, Iraq-Syria. Elusive Pursuits is intended to provide lessons learned for that paratrooper and the policymakers that will send him drifting to the ground the next time, wherever and whenever that may be.The volume is inspired by the formal end of the Afghanistan mission in 2014, which looms large in the Canadian consciousness. Or, to be more precise, what looms large is the deadly 2006-2011 period of counter-insurgency in Kandahar. This informs the scope of \"intervention\" laid out in the editors' introduction, which defines it narrowly as \"the use of force to affect the domestic dynamics of another country, with the broad aim of contributing to international peace and security\" (3). It is for the best, however, that the contributors do not strictly adhere to this definition. After all, Canada's experience with \"intervention\" is much broader than the introduction lets on. Thus, Elusive Pursuit's principal strength is the broad perspective it takes on intervention and the insights that flow from diverse scholarship on the issue. The individual contributions in this volume cover a wide expanse of issues that serve to remind readers of the scope and implications of Canada's interventions over the past 25 years. There are chapters on Canada's recent high-profile combat experiences in Iraq/Syria, Kandahar, and Libya, but also on diplomatic responses to the Arab Spring, security sector reform initiatives in Haiti, and the disastrous peacekeeping and aid mission in Somalia, the consequences of which still linger. Furthermore, there are up-to-date analyses of how Canadian government institutions and society have evolved during the post-September 11 era.Undoubtedly, though, the most ambitious and controversial chapter in Elusive Pursuits tries to articulate the Harper Doctrine on military intervention by schematizing the operational code that informed Stephen Harper's \"duty-driven internationalism.\" Authors Derek Burney, Fen Osler Hampson, and Simon Palamar make the important observation that Harper's interventions appeared to mimic the humanitarian and multilateral impulses of liberal internationalism, but his pathways to military intervention are entirely different. \u2026", "authors": ["Aaron Ettinger"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2017}}, "20": {"0": {"title": "Classification Program and Story Boundaries Segmentation in TV News Broadcast Videos via Deep Convolutional Neural Network", "abstract": "Given the amount of video information on the net, the user has had difficulty finding the information in a reasonable amount of time.

An organized archive of newscast is a prerequisite for any such analysis. Creating such archive requires segmentation of continuous news videos into suitable logical units. Based on the application, these logical units may be one of channel content obtained after advertisement removal, different shows, news stories or video shots. In this work, we propose an end to end system with software architecture for segmenting the TV broadcast videos at all these four granularities. The videos are segmented into shots. Video shots are used as basic unit for all further processing. Video shots are first subjected to advertisement detection and removal to obtain the non-commercial channel content. This channel content is further processed to identify various program boundaries. We propose to identify three types of shows based on the presentation format viz. news bulletins, interviews and debates. News bulletins so obtained are processed further to obtain news stories.

In addition, the digitalization of television in Indonesia is useful in terms of frequency efficiency itself and the quality of broadcast videos. Besides that there are other technologies that have better video quality than Analog TV, namely Internet Television Protocol (IPTV). IPTV utilizes the internet protocol as a medium for channeling its content. IPTV and DVB-T2 Digital TV have better picture quality than Analog TV. But IPTV technology was first used and had a different protocol compared to Digital DVB-T2 TV.

This process has been fraught, and has demonstrated the inherent risks in current approaches and accepted standards of quantitative evidence synthesis when dealing with high volumes of recent, often unpublished trial data of variable quality. Research into the use of ivermectin (a drug that has an established safety and efficacy record in many parasitic diseases) for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of COVID-19 has illustrated this problem well. Recently, we described flaws in one randomized control trial of ivermectin1, the results of which represented more than 10% of the overall effect in at least two major meta-analyses2,3. We described several irregularities in the data that could not be consistent with them being experimentally derived4. That study has now been withdrawn by the preprint server5 on which it was hosted. We also raised concerns about unexpected stratification across baseline variables in another randomized controlled trial for ivermectin6, which were highly suggestive of randomization failure. We have requested data from the authors but, as of 6 September 2021, have not yet received a response. This second ivermectin study has now been published6, and there is still no response from the authors in a request for data. The authors of one recently published meta-analysis of ivermectin for COVID-193 have publicly stated that they will now reanalyze and republish their now-retracted meta-analysis and will no longer include either of the two papers just mentioned. As these two papers1,6 were the only studies included in that meta-analysis to demonstrate an independently significant reduction in mortality, the revision will probably show no mortality benefit for ivermectin. Several other studies that claim a clinical benefit for ivermectin are similarly fraught, and contain impossible numbers in their results, unexplainable mismatches between trial registry updates and published patient demographics, purported timelines that are not consistent with the veracity of the data collection, and substantial methodological weaknesses. We expect further studies supporting ivermectin to be withdrawn over the coming months. Since the above primary studies were published, many hundreds of thousands of patients7 have been dosed with ivermectin, relying on an evidence base that has substantially evaporated under close scrutiny. Relying on low-quality or questionable studies in the current global climate presents severe and immediate harms. The enormous impact of COVID-19 and the consequent urgent need to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of new therapeutic options provides fertile ground for even poorly evidenced claims of efficacy to be amplified, both in the scientific literature and on social media. This context can lead to the rapid translation of almost any apparently favorable conclusion from a relatively weak trial or set of trials into widespread clinical practice and public policy. We believe that this situation requires immediate remediation. The most salient change required is a change in perspective on the part of both primary researchers and those who bring together the results of individual studies to draw wider conclusions. Specifically, we propose that clinical research should be seen as a contribution of data toward a larger omnibus question rather than an assemblage of summary statistics. Most, if not all, of the flaws described above would have been immediately detected if meta-analyses were performed on an individual patient data (IPD) basis. In particular, irregularities such as extreme terminal digit bias and the duplication of blocks of patient records would have been both obvious and immediately interrogable from raw data if provided. We recommend that meta-analysts who study interventions for COVID-19 should request and personally review IPD in all cases, even if IPD synthesis techniques are not used. In a similar vein, all clinical trials published on COVID-19 should immediately follow best-practice guidelines and upload anonymized IPD so that this type of analysis can occur. Any study for which authors are not able or not willing to provide suitably anonymized IPD should be considered at high risk of bias for incomplete reporting and/or excluded entirely from meta-syntheses. Hurdles to the release of IPD from clinical trials are well described, and generally addressable with careful anonymization and integration of data sharing plans at the ethical approval stage of trial planning. We recognize that this is a change to long-accepted practice and is substantially more rigorous than the standards that are typically currently applied, but we believe that what has happened in the case of ivermectin justifies our proposal: a poorly scrutinized evidence base supported the administration of millions of doses of a potentially ineffective drug globally, and yet when this evidence was subjected to a very basic numerical scrutiny it collapsed in a matter of weeks. This research has created undue confidence in the use of ivermectin as a prophylactic or treatment for COVID-19, has usurped other research agendas, and probably resulted in inappropriate treatment or substandard care of patients. We recognize that by recommending IPD review by default for meta-analysis of potential therapeutic agents in COVID19 we are calling for change to nearly universally accepted practice over many decades, but the consequent potential for patient harm on a global scale demands nothing less. \u2750", "authors": ["Jack M Lawrence", "G.

Antimicrobial resistance makes it harder to eliminate infections as existing drugs become less effective. In 1945, Alexander Fleming already warned that misuse of antibiotics could result in the selection of resistant bacteria. AMR is a growing public health threat, and many governments have adopted policies to combat it as in the future common infections could become fatal. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), \u201cthe development of resistance is a normal evolutionary process for microorganisms, but it is accelerated by the selective pressure exerted by widespread use of antibacterial drugs. Resistant strains are able to propagate and spread where there is non-compliance with infection prevention and control measures\u201d [1]. Unless action is taken, it is estimated that by 2050, up to ten million additional lives will be lost prematurely each year because of AMR. From European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARS-Net) data collected in 2015, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimated 670,000 infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and these infections accounted for an estimated 33,000 attributable deaths and 870,000 disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The burden for the EU and European Economic Area has increased since 2007 and was highest in Italy and Greece [2]. In the USA, resistant bacteria are believed to affect approximately 2 million people and could annually cause more than 23,000 deaths [3]. There are epidemiological, economic and health care organisation factors which contribute to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria: social mobility and concentration of population in urban areas facilitate transmission of infections and bacteria carrying antibiotic-resistant genes; cheap antibiotics (many antibacterial groups cost less than half a Euro a day), the growth of per capita income in many countries, and the consideration of health as a high incomeelasticity good (increasing income drives a higher demand for drugs in general and antibiotics in particular). These are all economic factors that drive higher antibiotic consumption. Health care organisation also influences antibiotic consumption depending on how patients access the system and whom they are referred to for treatment. The ECDC estimates that 30\u201350% of all antibiotics prescribed in Europe do not benefit patients and thus simply increase the risk of harm to individuals, society, and future generations. For example, of all patients consulting for an acute cough, which is one of the most important reasons for consultation, experts estimate that only 10% should be prescribed an antibiotic, whereas the actual proportion of prescribed antibiotics in EU countries was 50% overall with a range from just over 20% to 80% [4, 5]. Several researchers analysed antibiotic consumption trends and worldwide distribution. In a recent publication by Klein et al. [6], it was found that during the period 2010\u20132015, the increase of consumption, measured as the number of defined daily doses (DDD), in the 76 countries analysed increased 65% (from 21.1 to 34.8 billion DDD), and the antibiotic consumption rate increased 39% (from 11.3 to 15.7 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day). As a general result, high-income countries average about 25 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day with a slightly negative trend during that period, while low and middle-income countries average about 15 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day with a strong positive trend, which may lead to a convergence in consumption in the near future. * F.

But for the most part, my family and I spent our newfound time keeping up with global news. Whether we were playing card games or cooking dinner, we always kept the news on as a remaining connection to the outside world. Having been involved in translational medical research throughout high school, I particularly gravitated towards the developing research on COVID-19 therapies and vaccines. I would wind up spending many of those quarantine hours perusing the new journal articles being published each day, watching developments such as hydroxychloroquine come and go from the digital headlines. So, when searching for a Writing 101 course, Dr. Cary Moskovitz\u2019s COVID-19: Facts or Fake News? immediately caught my eye. The class became an invaluable experience in exploring the diverse spectrum of online COVID-19 health claims from multiple unique modes of thought. From politics-infused opinions to conflicting scientific data, I learned strategies to harness these contradictory claims into my own arguments and conclusions. Our final project was a commentary\u2014an evidence-based perspective on how the public should interpret an emerging COVID-19 health claim. Tapping again into my research experience, I chose to explore the opposing opinions on a controversial new drug for COVID-19 patients through an extensive review of current literature. I wanted to highlight the limitations in peerreviewed scientific studies and emphasize the frequent disconnect between these limitations and how science news is presented to the public. I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Moskovitz for his continuous support and his exceptionally thought-provoking classes that made this piece possible. His insightful feedback always challenged me to think about my piece from different perspectives. I would also like to thank Dr. Sheryl Welte Emch for her assistance throughout the publication process and the entire Deliberations editorial board for their valuable suggestions and feedback. I March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, spurring researchers and physicians alike into an international initiative to discover and test potential treatments. Similar to previous infectious disease outbreaks, the development of new experimental therapies encountered a significant barrier: the rigorous pipeline from \u201cbench to bedside\u201d, which can take upwards of ten years, must be required for proper evaluation of new medicines (DocWire News Featured Reading, 2019). As COVID-19 cases continued to increase around the world, many efforts turned instead to the repurposing of drugs previously approved by the FDA in an urgent rush to develop new therapies during this emergency phase. Ivermectin is one such FDA-approved drug that has made global headlines as a repurposed medicine for COVID-19 treatment. The premise for exploring ivermectin as a COVID-19 therapy was motivated by its ability to block molecules from entering the cell nucleus, an essential step for the replication of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (Wagstaff et al., 2012). After Australian researchers demonstrated the drug to be a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in vitro in April 2020 (Caly et al., 2020), ivermectin was touted as a \u201cmiracle drug\u201d by some in the medical community (TrialSite Staff, 2020), and physicians began compassionate prescription of the drug as part of their COVID-19 treatment regimens (Mega, 2020). The wave of enthusiasm for ivermectin quickly disseminated through the public via global media outlets and perhaps gained the greatest traction in Latin America, where the Peru and Bolivia ministries of health authorized its use for treating COVID-19 patients (Hlavinka, 2020). A significant majority in the medical community have remained skeptical, however, of the silver bullet promises of ivermectin. Citing faulty scientific data and a lack of concrete evidence, pharmaceutical researchers and FDA health officials alike have been extremely cautious in accepting the hype behind ivermectin, likely with the hydroxychloroquine fiasco still fresh in recent memory (\u201cMerck Statement,\u201d 2021; \u201cWhy You Should Not Use,\u201d 2021).

Despite their importance, adherence to these medications is low. Low adherence is linked to increased exacerbation rates, mortality rates, health care utilization, and, ultimately, increased costs. A drug adherence index (DAI) is a predictive modeling tool that identifies patients most likely to change adherence status so that they can be targeted for support programs. Optum has previously developed DAI tools for diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. In this study, a COPD-specific DAI was developed. This DAI tool could be used to better target medication adherence support in patients with COPD, aiming to increase adherence. OBJECTIVES: To develop a COPD-specific DAI using (a) enrollment, medical, and pharmacy variables and (b) only enrollment and pharmacy variables for potential application to pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacy plans. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study using health care claims among Medicare Advantage with Part D beneficiaries with COPD in the United States. Potential predictors of adherence were measured during a 1-year baseline period. The adherence outcome was measured during a subsequent 1-year at-risk period. Adherence to long-acting bronchodilators was defined as a proportion of days covered (PDC) \u226580%. Nonadherence was defined as a PDC of <80%. Patients were stratified according to their adherence status at baseline, and logistic regression models were developed separately for each set of patients. Separate models were also developed using enrollment, medical, and pharmacy variables (primary objective) or using enrollment and pharmacy variables only (secondary objective). RESULTS: A total of 61,507 patients met all inclusion and exclusion criteria. For the primary objective, at baseline, 31,142 patients were adherent and 30,365 patients were nonadherent. The final DAI model used to predict future nonadherence included 30 covariates, with 7 predictors from medical claims. The validated model c-statistic was 0.752. The final DAI model used to predict future adherence included 29 covariates; only 4 predictors were from medical claims. The validated model c-statistic was 0.691. Findings were similar for the secondary objective using only enrollment and pharmacy variables. CONCLUSIONS: This DAI was developed and validated specifically to predict future adherence status to long-acting bronchodilator medications among patients with COPD. The DAI models performed better for predicting nonadherence than predicting adherence. Both organizations with medical and pharmacy data and organizations with only pharmacy data could utilize the DAI tool to target patients for adherence programs, as results were similar with and without the use of medical variables.

A massive programme is now underway to treat the parasites of the poor in Africa via integrated vertical interventions of mass drug administration in endemic areas. The approach has been hailed as remarkably effective, with claims that there is now a real prospect of complete control and, for some NTDs, even elimination. However, a closer look at evaluation and research data reveals that much less is known about what is being achieved than is suggested. Competition between implementing organisations is leading to potentially counterproductive exaggerations about treatment coverage. Detailed local-level research in Uganda and Tanzania shows that actual rates of drug take-up among target populations are often lower than is necessary to effectively control the diseases, and that methods of drug distribution may even lead to active resistance to treatment.

A novel method of analyzing drug efficacy studies in human helminthiases is proposed and used to investigate recent claims of atypical responses to ivermectin in the treatment of River Blindness. The variability in the rate at which Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae repopulate host's skin following ivermectin treatment is quantified using an individual-based onchocerciasis mathematical model. The model estimates a single skin repopulation rate for every host sampled, allowing reports of suboptimal responses to be statistically compared with responses from populations with no prior exposure to ivermectin. Statistically faster rates of skin repopulation were observed in 3 Ghanaian villages (treated 12\u201317 times), despite the wide variability in repopulation rates observed in ivermectin-na\u00efve populations. Another village previously thought to have high rates of skin repopulation was shown to be indistinguishable from the normal treatment response. The model is used to generate testable hypotheses to identify whether atypical rates of skin repopulation by microfilariae could result from low treatment coverage alone or provide evidence of decreased ivermectin efficacy. Further work linking phenotypic poor responses to treatment with parasite molecular genetics markers will be required to confirm drug resistance. Limitations of the skin-snipping method for estimating parasite load indicates that changes in the distribution of microfilarial repopulation rates, rather than their absolute values, maybe a more sensitive indicator of emerging ivermectin resistance.", "authors": ["T.

Since the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), synthetic media has become increasingly difficult to identify. Synthetic videos that contain altered faces and/or voices of a person are known as deepfakes and threaten trust and privacy in digital media. Deep-fakes can be weaponized for political advantage, slander, and to undermine the reputation of public figures. Despite imperfections of deepfakes, people struggle to distinguish between authentic and manipulated images and videos. Consequently, it is important to have automated systems that accurately and efficiently classify the validity of digital content. Many recent deepfake detection methods use single frames of video and focus on the spatial information in the image to infer the authenticity of the video. Some promising approaches exploit the temporal inconsistencies of manipulated videos; however, research primarily focuses on spatial features. We propose a hybrid deep learning approach that uses spatial, spectral, and temporal content that is coupled in a consistent way to differentiate real and fake videos. We show that the Discrete Cosine transform can improve deepfake detection by capturing spectral features of individual frames.

Let\u2019s Find Your Optimal Delivery Time!\u201d: The Impact of Delivery Time on Retailer Profit in a Heterogeneous Market", "abstract": "In order to make online shopping more attractive to consumers, many retailers have endeavored to reduce the time between when an order is placed and when it is received. The cost of delivery and logistical challenges are obvious impediments to faster delivery. In this paper, we examine how other factors, including the presence of physical channels and consumer heterogeneity (in shopping preferences and product valuations), impact the optimal delivery time. To isolate the effects of these alternative factors, we ask whether faster delivery is always profitable even if it is costless to the firm and if there is no logistical impediment. (Removing these two assumptions only strengthens our results.) We contribute to the extant literature by being the first (to the best of our knowledge) to demonstrate that shipping time can be used to segment a market more efficiently and to identify how heterogeneity in consumers\u2019 preferences for online vs. offline shopping impact the optimal shipping time (which, in turn, alters the resulting mix of online and offline sales). More specifically, we use a stylized analytical model to study how delivery time affects the profit of a multi-channel retailer who operates an online store as well as physical stores in two different cities. In accordance with prevailing wisdom, we show that delaying delivery cannot enhance a retailer\u2019s profit if the two cities are homogenous. However, interestingly, we find that it can be profitable for the retailer to delay delivery if the two cities are heterogeneous (even though there are not any cost savings from longer delivery times). In particular, this Delayed Delivery strategy is optimal if (a) consumers\u2019 travel costs to the physical store are small, but not too small, (b) there is large heterogeneity in consumer valuations across the two cities, and (c) high-value customers experience substantially higher disutility from shopping online than do low-value consumers. We find that consideration of the Delayed Delivery strategy has important implications for retailers. In particular, by delaying delivery, a retailer who previously only operated physical stores may find that opening an online channel would be profitable (whereas an online channel would not have been desirable if there were not any delay in delivery). Conversely, a multichannel retailer may find that opening additional physical stores becomes advantageous if delivery from the online store is delayed. Furthermore, delaying delivery can alter whether the online store should target low-value consumers, high-value ones, or both types of consumers. Finally, counterintuitively, we show that the Delayed Delivery strategy can lead to higher consumers\u2019 surplus, so that a win-win scenario is created because both the firm and consumers benefit from online orders being delivered less promptly.

The three Vs of big data are: Volume\u2014large low-density unstructured datasets. Velocity\u2014received very rapidly, e.g., accumulation may be real time. Variety\u2014inputs are highly variable e.g., images, audio, text, web clicks. If we accept this definition the label is almost always erroneously applied in ophthalmology where our datasets are of a size which allow conventional or artificial intelligence analysis (another term used loosely and usually indicating artificial neural networks or deep learning). The first appearance was with the use of \u201cbig data people\u201d by Charles Tilly in 1980 referring to historians using data in cliometrics (applying methods used in statistics and economics to history). When it morphed into its current usage is uncertain. The phrase is now common in the public vernacular and therefore the definition varies as the use of the label develops. It might be expanded to mean the datasets of a few thousand to those of millions of records along with the analytics to study these datasets. Whatever its meaning, the belief that the sizes of the datasets are so big as to iron out potential biases in data collection is certainly wrong. Big data analyses have the same potential problems as observational studies in medicine, including missing values, confounding, lack of generalisability and bias control to name a few [1, 2]. Over-simplistic application has led to error before [3]. An evangelical belief that big data are infallible because of their size does us no good, and will lead us down the wrong road if we do not exercise our usual scientific scepticism and criticism. For example, as datasets increase in size spurious correlations also increase. If a simulated set of 200 variables is given only 1000 data points each, then a correlation would be expected to be found even though the variables are meaningless. By definition the use of big data enables the researcher to fit a hypothesis to the findings and not the other way around, introducing potential for biases. The data accumulation allows a researcher to reach a finding and stop analysis rather than to force analysis at a predetermined time point. Any findings are associations which will then need experimental testing [4]. Some areas where big data have been used well is in media and entertainment (e.g. predicting viewing patterns on Netflix), weather forecasting, transport, government (security and welfare) and banking. In healthcare Apple has introduced Healthkit, Carekit and Researchkit to allow the recording of data but we will need to wait to see how these work. It is however a far cry from the extremely structured data collection and validation that we expect in clinical research. Whereas we are intolerant of incomplete or inaccurate data collection in research, there is an expectation that somehow big data, because of its size, will miraculously iron out such errors. It is possible however that instead it is amplifying such error or at least giving it false credibility. When good data and bad data are combined the weakest link dictates. It may be that higher statistical thresholds will be required [5]. The input behaviours of the users of a digital technology cannot be altered post hoc by analysis. A good example is the use of EMR system only for surgical input and not as a full clinical record. If used along with a written clinical record, there is the possibility of recording for medicolegal purposes a surgical complication in the written notes and not in the EMR. Hey presto your digital record shows a low complication rate to compare yourself with other surgeons. I have seen examples of this when studying records for medicolegal expert opinions.

However, much recent work on big data in public decision-making assumes a rational view of decision-making, which has been much criticized in the public administration debate. In this paper, we apply this view, and a more political one, to the context of big data and offer a qualitative study. We question the impact of big data on decision-making, realizing that big data \u2013 including its new methods and functions \u2013 must inevitably encounter existing political and managerial institutions. By studying two illustrative cases of big data use processes, we explore how these two worlds meet. Specifically, we look at the interaction between data analysts and decision makers. In this we distinguish between a rational view and a political view, and between an information logic and a decision logic. We find that big data provides ample opportunities for both analysts and decision makers to do a better job, but this doesn't necessarily imply better decision-making, because big data also provides opportunities for actors to pursue their own interests. Big data enables both data analysts and decision makers to act as autonomous agents rather than as links in a functional chain. Therefore, big data's impact cannot be interpreted only in terms of its functional promise; it must also be acknowledged as a phenomenon set to impact our policymaking institutions, including their legitimacy. 1. Big data analytics improves decision-making, but how? The promise of big data analytics to \u201cpredict the present\u201d (Choi, 2012) and even the future (Goel, 2010) make big data potentially invaluable for decision-making. The literature on big data shows an abundance of these potentials. For example, big data analytics regarding customer preferences and behaviours and market trends can improve business intelligence and business decisions (H. Chen, Chiang, & Storey, 2012; P. Simon, 2013). Big data can be used to extract trends where none could previously be found, and it can support evidencebased policymaking. In the public sector, big data can help officials make better decisions (OMalley, 2014) and improve overall government efficiency and effectiveness (Milakovich, 2012). Big data can provide support information for better-informed policymaking (Janssen & Kuk, 2016), based on near real-time insights into societal patterns and citizen needs (Y.-C. Chen & Hsieh, 2014b) and through improved policy evaluation (Schintler, 2014). There is much literature on the potential of big data or barriers to its use (e.g. H. Chen et al., 2012; Choi, 2012; H\u00f6chtl, Parycek, & Schollhammer, 2016; OMalley, 2014). Yet, when implemented in real public decision-making processes, big data both serves and challenges institutions. Indeed, the meeting of big data with public institutions may well have unforeseen consequences. Big data could potentially affect existing roles within organizations regarding the use of knowledge, and it may alter decision-making, agenda setting, policy formulation, incentive structures, capabilities and many more of the processes through which public policymaking is nowadays shaped (Klievink, Romijn, Cunningham, & Bruijn, 2017). The current emphasis on the potential merits of big data relies on a functional theory of decision-making; simply, that big data leads to better information and therefore to better decisions. So, while it is commonly suggested that big data can improve decision-making, it remains implicit how decision-making will be improved in practice (see, e.g. Arnaboldi, Busco, & Cuganesan, 2017). This implicit functional theory likely lacks explanatory value, as it neglects the institutions that shape the process from data generation to the decisions taken. This may hamper our ability to explain or prevent disappointments in big data implementation projects. This paper therefore focuses not on the potential of big data, but rather on how big data is used for public decisions, in decision-making processes. We challenge the abovementioned implicit theory by examining different, even competing, analytical views. Moreover, we advance the field by applying these views to empirically study the process of big-data use in decision-making. Through these conceptual and empirical steps, we seek to answer the question of how big data impacts public decision-making. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2018.10.011 Received 29 December 2017; Received in revised form 15 October 2018; Accepted 15 October 2018 \u204e Corresponding author.

T After introducing the main concepts \u2018big data\u2019 and \u2018decision-making\u2019 in Section 2, we build an analytical framework by juxtaposing two theoretical dimensions: one being the nature of public decision-making processes and the other being the salience of either the data provision side or the data use side. This yields four theses and four corresponding research questions. The questions, which Section 3 discusses in detail, are the following: 1. What opportunities might big data provide data analysts to provide better information to decision makers? 2. What opportunities might big data provide decision makers to better absorb information from data analysts? 3. What opportunities might big data provide data analysts to pursue their own interests while providing information to decision makers? 4. What opportunities might big data provide decision makers to pursue their own interests while absorbing information from data analysts? Section 4 introduces the research approach, which is based on two exploratory case studies: a dashboard for tracking criminal incidents in Tilburg (Netherlands), and the Digital Traces project in Milan (Italy). Sections 5 and 6, respectively, present these cases. The focus of this qualitative part is on big data use processes, encompassing the sequence of activities from data collection to decision-making (i.e., how big data is used) (Janssen, Van der Voort, & Wahyudi, 2017). In such processes, we view the roles of both data analysts, as information providers, and public decision makers as critical to the impact of big data. Section 7 analyses the two cases through the lens of our four theses. We then wrap up with conclusions in section eight and a discussion in section nine. 2. Big data and decision-making as a process \u2018Big data\u2019 is a big concept, covering a wide array of recent developments in the production and processing of data. Big data is often defined in terms of a number of \u2018V's\u2019, the early definitions focusing on three V's by describing big data as high-Volume, high-Velocity and high-Variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing for enhanced insight and decision making (Gartner, n.d.; Kitchin, 2014: 68). Over the years this definition, has been extended, with different definitions zooming in on different features. Each captures the idea that big data is relevant for decisionmaking, and extracts several aspects of the big data concept. In this paper, we follow Klievink et al. (2017) who defined big data not in terms of characteristics of the data, but in terms of the characteristics of their use (Klievink et al., 2017). They noted five characteristics that differentiate big data processing from conventional data processing: 1. use and combining of multiple, large datasets from various sources, both external and internal to the organization; 2. use and combining of structured (traditional) and less structured or unstructured (nontraditional) data in analysis activities; 3. use of incoming data streams in real time or near real time; 4. development and application of advanced analytics and algorithms, distributed computing and/or advanced technology to handle very large and complex computing tasks; and 5. innovative use of existing datasets and data sources for new and radically different applications than the data were gathered for or spring from. These five characteristics help to define big data, building on earlier conceptualizations (Adrian, 2011; M. Chen, Mao, & Liu, 2014; Davenport, Barth, & Bean, 2012; Gantz & Reinsel, 2011; Hota, Upadhyaya, & Al-Karaki, 2015; Janssen & Kuk, 2016; MayerSch\u00f6nberger & Cukier, 2013; P. Simon, 2013). Nonetheless, apart from a powerful promise, the full effects of big data on decision-making have rarely been systematically covered. Big data appears to have huge potential to create value for businesses and governments. However, it remains unclear what institutional mechanisms and factors may explain how big data creates business value (Janssen et al., 2017) and public value (Chatfield & Reddick, 2017). Janssen et al. and Chatfield and Reddick focused, respectively, on factors and conditions concerning data quality and public value creation. Our focus here is more process oriented. We view decisionmaking as a process leading to a certain choice (Simon, 1960). Besides the choice itself, this process involves problem formulation (intelligence) and generation of alternatives (design) (Simon, 1960). Simon argued that if decisions are complex enough, the phase of the generation of alternatives is already significant for the eventual choice, because this phase involves a selection, and the way alternatives are framed impacts the further decision. Many authors, including Simon and Janssen, present the decisionmaking process as a sequence of activities (e.g. Y.-C. Chen & Hsieh, 2014a; Marx, 2013). Some acknowledge, however, that during these activities many actors are of crucial importance for the output (the decision or decision quality) and outcome (value). Actors' invol", "authors": ["H. G.

It is a chronic condition characterized by abdominal pain in conjunction with altered bowel habits and abdominal distention and bloating. IBS can be clinically subtyped into IBS with constipation, IBS with diarrhea, or mixed IBS. Recent advances in IBS management include the new Rome IV criteria for diagnosis (released in 2016) and the addition of new nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches for treating patients who do not respond to lifestyle and dietary modifications. Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and stool irregularity. Symptoms range from mild to debilitating. Although this disorder is recognized worldwide, reported prevalence rates vary geographically from 1.1%45%. Prevalence rates of 5%10% are reported in the United States and most of Europe (1). It is more prevalent in women than in men, and the pathophysiology is not well-understood. Potential mechanisms include genetic factors, immune system alterations, changes in gut microbiota, alterations in bowel motility, visceral hypersensitivity, functional brain alterations, and psychosocial comorbidities (2). Diagnosis What symptoms should prompt a clinician to consider IBS? Although symptoms may vary from person to person, clinicians should consider IBS if a patient has abdominal discomfort or pain associated with bowel dysfunction. Abnormal stool frequency (>3 bowel movements per day or <3 bowel movements per week), excessive straining during defecation, urgency, and feeling of incomplete evacuation are common in patients with IBS but are nonspecific. Other suggestive symptoms include postprandial exacerbation of symptoms and excess gas and flatulence. Gastrointestinal symptoms that wax and wane for more than 2 years and are exacerbated by psychosocial stress should raise suspicion for IBS. The presence of other functional gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., nonulcer dyspepsia) as well as functional extraintestinal symptoms or syndromes, such as chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, sleep disturbance, and psychiatric comorbidity, favor an IBS diagnosis (3). Three defecation patterns are characteristic of IBS: constipation-predominant (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), and mixed (alternating diarrhea and constipation) (IBS-M). Determining a patient's predominant symptom pattern is useful in guiding management because the subgroups respond differently to the various therapeutic interventions. Individual symptom patterns can change over time; as a result, whether symptom pattern clearly distinguishes among IBS subtypes is debatable. Certain clinical features, often called alarm features or red-flag symptoms, suggest that the diagnosis is something other than IBS (see the Box: Alarm Features That Suggest Possible Organic Disease). Alarm features include weight loss, nocturnal awakening due to gastrointestinal symptoms, blood in the stool, family history of colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, recent use of antibiotics, and fever. Alarm Features That Suggest Possible Organic Disease Symptoms Weight loss Frequent nocturnal awakenings due to gastrointestinal symptoms Fever Blood in stool History New-onset, progressive symptoms Onset of symptoms after age 50 y Recent antibiotic use Family history of colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease Physical findings Abdominal mass Stool positive for occult blood Enlarged lymph nodes What are the accepted diagnostic criteria? History is the main diagnostic tool for IBS. The Manning criteria and the Rome criteria are 2 sets of symptom-based diagnostic criteria that help to discriminate between IBS and other disorders (see the Box: Symptom Criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome). These criteria, which were developed for use in research studies, can be helpful in clinical practice. Manning and colleagues (4) proposed the first widely used IBS criteria in 1978 based on the symptoms listed in the Box. In 1989, a group of experts met in Rome and developed another set of consensus-based criteria, known as the Rome criteria, to assist in the diagnosis of IBS and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (5). The Rome criteria were based on a broader array of symptoms than the Manning criteria and additionally considered both duration and frequency of symptoms. In 1999, the same group of experts developed the Rome II criteria, a modified version of the earlier criteria intended to be more adaptable to clinical practice (5). The most recent version of the Rome criteria, Rome IV, was released in May 2016 (6). IBS is now defined as recurrent abdominal pain associated with a change in stool form and/or frequency. The term abdominal discomfort, which was present in the Rome III criteria, has been removed because it was considered ambiguous. In addition, the frequency of abdominal pain required to meet the threshold for IBS has been changed from at least 3 days per month in the preceding 3 months (Rome III) to at least 1 day per week in the preceding 3 months (Rome IV). Finally, the criterion has been changed from improvement of abdominal pain with defecation to abdominal pain related to defecation to acknowledge that some patients with IBS may report worsening of abdominal pain after defecation. Rome IV continues to specify that some symptoms must have existed for at least 6 months and that patients must fulfill the Rome criteria for at least 3 months before IBS can be diagnosed. Rome IV also recharacterized IBS as a disorder of gutbrain interaction (DGBI) as opposed to a functional gastrointestinal disorder to offset the ambiguity and stigmatization associated with the term functional. Furthermore, IBS must be distinguished from other DGBIsalthough symptoms may overlap, these disorders are considered separate entities. The Rome criteria are seen as a work in progress, and future studies are needed to confirm the validity of recent changes and to examine the usefulness of the criteria in research and clinical settings (6). Symptom Criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome Rome IV criteria* Recurrent abdominal pain, on average 1 d/wk in the past 3 mo, related to 2 of the following: Defecation Change in stool frequency Change in stool form (appearance) Manning criteria Pain relief with defecation, often Looser stool at pain onset, often More frequent stools at pain onset, often Visible abdominal distention Mucus per rectum Feeling of incomplete evacuation *Criteria should be fulfilled for the past 3 mo with symptom onset 6 mo before diagnosis. To establish IBS diagnosis, patient must meet 3 criteria. When diagnostic criteria are satisfied; warning symptoms are absent; the history and physical examination suggest IBS; and the occult blood test, complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are normal, the risk for overlooking organic disease may be as low as 1%3%. Thus, expert consensus is that physicians should limit evaluation to fulfillment of the Rome criteria if no alarm symptoms are present. Even without exclusion of alarm features, the presence of at least 3 of the 6 Manning criteria has an average sensitivity of approximately 60% and specificity of approximately 80%. The criteria's sensitivity and specificity vary by study, and diagnostic accuracy is known to be better in women, in younger patients, and when more criteria are fulfilled (7). Reports show that sensitivity and specificity of the Rome criteria range from 69%96% and 72%85%, respectively. The major drawback with these reports is the lack of a gold standard for IBS diagnosis (8). What is the utility of the physical examination? Although physical examination is usually normal in patients with IBS, mild abdominal tenderness may be present. A digital rectal examination should be done to evaluate the possibility of dyssynergic defecation (which is characterized by paradoxical contraction of the rectal sphincter on bearing down and abnormal perineal descent, and is important to exclude in patients with constipation) as well as to rule out rectal cancer (9). Such physical findings as fever, weight loss, lymph node enlargement, abdominal mass, and hepatosplenomegaly are typically not associated with IBS and should prompt pursuit of other diagnoses. Which diagnostic tests are useful? There are no specific diagnostic tests for IBS. In patients who fulfill the symptom-based diagnostic criteria for IBS and have no alarm features, routine use of diagnostic tests is not recommended. Obtaining a complete blood count and complete metabolic panel and measuring C-reactive protein is reasonable according to current literature; these tests are inexpensive and can reassure both provider and patient (10). If the clinical suspicion for thyroid disease is high, a thyroid profile should be obtained. A serologic test for celiac disease (by measuring levels of tissue transglutaminase antibody) may be useful in nonconstipated patients with IBSa recent large multicenter trial showed that the prevalence of celiac disease in patients with IBS was appreciably higher than in controls (11). Endoscopy Patients with symptoms compatible with IBS, lack of alarm features, and unremarkable preliminary laboratory tests do not require additional invasive investigations. Of note, performing invasive tests does not increase patient satisfaction or improve quality of life (12). Colonoscopy should be considered when alarm features are present or the history or laboratory studies raise concern about an underlying inflammatory condition. It should also be considered based on the indications for colon cancer screening, especially in countries with population screening programs. Evaluation of stool samples Clostridium difficile infection should be excluded in patients with IBS-D who have recently received antibiotics. Examination of stool for ova and parasites may also be helpful in these patients, especially if travel histo", "authors": ["S. Sultan", "A.

Therefore, directly borrowing image or video compression techniques, such as discrete cosine transform, does not work well. In this paper, we propose a novel mocap-tailored transform coding algorithm that takes advantage of these features. Our algorithm segments the input mocap sequences into clips, which are represented in 2D matrices. Then it computes a set of data-dependent orthogonal bases to transform the matrices to frequency domain, in which the transform coefficients have significantly less dependency. Finally, the compression is obtained by entropy coding of the quantized coefficients and the bases. Our method has low computational cost and can be easily extended to compress mocap databases. It also requires neither training nor complicated parameter setting.

Combined with the CForce Mini lens control system, the UAS gave unparalleled camera and lens control at extended ranges, providing complete pan, tilt and lens control and allowing dynamic moves in the air.

For a few short years in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Glasgow led the world in its development. A unique collaboration between clinical obstetrics, engineering, electronics and industrial design expertise created the very first prototypes and production models of ultrasound scanners for use in routine obstetrics scanning - anywhere in the world - for use in Glasgow hospitals \nThe seminal 1958 Lancet paper by Donald, MacVicar and Brown first alerted the medical profession to the possibilities of the use of pulsed ultrasound in obstetrics. Initially adapted from an industrial application for checking pressure vessels, the development of ultrasound devices for obstetrics purposes faced many challenges, e.g., how to adapt the existing technology for its new purpose, how to match the apparatus to the perceptual faculties of the human user, how best to image the developing foetus in its mother\u2019s womb, and how to ensure the design of the equipment was acceptable, usable and commercially viable for manufacture. \n \nThis publication accompanies the exhibition Ultrasonic Glasgow held at The Glasgow School of Art (GSA) in October 2019. It acknowledges the early Glasgow pioneers of ultrasound and their innovations. While previous accounts have focussed on and celebrated the medical, technical engineering and imaging achievements of this innovation, less has been said about the role of creative design and the thought processes behind the design decisions. Drawing from archival material (including drawings), witness accounts and contemporary interviews, Ultrasonic Glasgow repositions the creative, imaginative, conceptual and technical skills of the designer, documenting and highlighting the pivotal role of design in the development process through the work of the then graduating designer, Dugald Cameron, who later became GSA\u2019s Director between 1991 and 1999. Cameron\u2019s work, in his first paid commission, transformed a brilliant innovation but a clumsy piece of technical apparatus into an elegant, usable product design and, in so doing, helped revolutionize the clinical management of antenatal treatment and care in Glasgow and beyond: now, every woman in the developed world has at least one scan during her pregnancy. The fragile surviving drawings and photographs endure to form the centrepiece of this exhibition to allow us to scrutinise the very marks on paper that reveal the thoughts of Cameron\u2019s highly creative mind to make this apparatus acceptable to and usable by both patient and operator. \nWith a focus on drawing in the academy, Dr Frances Robertson, Reader in the Department of Design History and Theory, expands accounts of the designer-engineer role through visualisations and conceptions of the \u2018body\u2019 as an element in the design process through designer training and drawing practices, discussing the sensibilities fostered by the life drawing class and its influences on design. In a companion piece, the necessity of drawing as the fundamental skill in the designer\u2019s training is re-asserted by Cameron, still drawing daily. \n \nIn earlier accounts little, if anything, has been said about the experiences of expectant mothers encountering this then pioneering technology. Susan Roan and Emma Keogh, lecturers in Communication Design, have drawn out, from midwives and expectant mothers in the period 1963-1968 fascinating testimonies of first-hand experiences of early ultrasound procedures and encounters with Donald and his team, in Glasgow hospitals. \n \nResonating with Cameron\u2019s achievements 60-plus years on, new imaginings for emerging ultrasound technologies are envisioned by GSA's current cohort of young Product Design Engineering students, that innovative GSA and University of Glasgow joint programme initiated and co-founded by Cameron in 1987.

Introduction Although oil and gas exploration applies numerical modeling techniques to understand the development of hydrocarbon-bearing basins and to provide quantitative subsurface models, the quantity of reliable data available to build models is very limited compared to the size of sedimentary basins. Indeed, only cores collected from relatively few exploration and development wells provide direct and quantitative subsurface information. In contrast, sedimentary rocks outcrops, by their areal coverage and direct accessibility to geologists, provide excellent analogues to the subsurface that should be quantitatively integrated to the reservoir characterization and modeling workflow. Although outcrops are valuable sources of information that should be used to characterize the subsurface, we are far from achieving the objective of fully benefiting from outcrops. Indeed, despite the fact that an outcrop is directly accessible, its quantitative modeling and integration remain an issue. Field trips are usually organized in such a manner that several experienced geologists are involved in collecting descriptive data from outcrops, which include rock samples, measured sections, and photos. The outcomes from these field trips are mainly conceptual and qualitative models of the surface geology without any quantitative impact on the subsurface modeling. Moreover, in numerous occurrences accessibility to cliffs or canyons in any outcrop is a major obstacle to its complete study. The main goal of this work, to investigate alternative technologies for high-resolution 3D outcrop modeling (cm to mm scale), resulting in a virtual dataset that a geologist can visit at any time from his desktop and extract in real-time any piece of information/data needed. These could then be easily integrated in the subsurface modeling workflow to enhance characterization and reduce uncertainties. The proposed solution for this challenge is to develop an integrated workflow for remote geological assessment based on drones and remote sensing. The general workflow starts with the selection of an area of interest and the use of a geographic information system (GIS) in planning the flight route of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This is then followed by selection of the model type, for instance, digital elevation, texture, and/or mineral composition as well as the required resolution; information is needed to select suitable sensors and drones for the data acquisition. After acquiring the data using drones equipped with the appropriate sensors, we proceed to data processing, where the acquired data is converted to geological models that geologists can use to study the outcrop. The need for millimeter-scale resolution requires intensive computational resources to be able to process large data volumes in reasonable amounts of time. Finally, general-purpose software is used for outcrop model visualization. In addition, specific tools can be developed for geoscientists to facilitate the interaction between the geologists and the virtual outcrop, e.g., for horizon picking, or core extraction. This workflow was successfully applied to the Wadi Dirab outcrop in central Saudi Arabia. Multiple models were generated with resolutions ranging from 2 cm (as a baseline resolution) to 1 mm (for targeted locations / measured sections). Such high-resolution outcrop models are a key step in providing analogues for subsurface reservoirs that will consolidate our understanding of their vertical and lateral heterogeneities, as well as facies architecture within them. Although this new workflow still has to be validated and can be fundamentally improved, it already has demonstrated its usefulness for geological outcrop documentation and modeling in remote areas. Wadi Dirab: The Hanifa Formation The economic conventional hydrocarbon accumulations found within the Hanifa Formation, as well as its potential for unconventional plays, make it one of the important Jurassic units in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the Hanifa Formation surface geology could provide real 3-dimensional analogues for the reservoir in the subsurface. Such analogues would provide information about the depositional facies and their vertical and lateral relationships, which in turn will help address facies architecture and flow units when constructing reservoir models for simulation. Recent work by Fallatah and Kerans (2018) examined the Hanifa Formation at a regional scale at its exposure in the Tuwaiq Mountains in Central Arabia (Figure 1). The study detailed the sedimentology and stratigraphy of the formation and recognized areas that have exposures of reservoir facies. One of these areas is Wadi Dirab, where the complete section of the Hanifa Formation with its contacts with underlying and overlying formations is exposed. The Hanifa is preceded by the Tuwaiq Mountain Limestone and succeeded by the Jubaila Formation (Figure 2). Hughes et al. (2008) recognized the basal contact with the Tuwaiq Mountain Limestone as a paraconformity surface, whereas a disconformity was recognized for the upper contact with the Jubaila Formation. Based on the ammonite Euaspidoceras perarmatum identified in the lower member of the formation, Hawtah, the Hanifa Formation is assigned to Oxfordian age (Vaslet et al., 1983; Manivit et al., 1985). In contrast, because of the presence of echinoderm species Pygurus smelthei and Polycyphus parvituberculatus in the upper Ulayyah Member of the Hanifa, the top of the formation is assigned to late Oxfordian \u2013 early Kimmeridgian age (Manivit et al., 1985). The lateral extension of Wadi Dirab outcrop (5,000,000 m2), the thickness of the Hanifa Formation (113 m), the number of needed measured sections (7 measured sections), and the risk associated with difficult access to most of the outcrop made this location an excellent candidate to test and validate this new workflow, combining drone-based remote sensing and digital photogrammetry (Figure 3). Digital Photogrammetry Photogrammetry is the \u201cart, science and technology of obtaining reliable information about physical objects and the environment through the process of recording, measuring and interpreting photographic images and patterns of electromagnetic radiant imagery and other phenomena\u201d (American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing [https://www.asprs.org/]. Photogrammetry was first introduced in 1851 by Colonel Aim\u00e9 Laussedat (https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/laussedat-aime/), but it was not until almost 60 years later that the technique was successfully employed during World War I. Over time, the development of photogrammetry has passed through the phases of plane-table photogrammetry, analog photogrammetry, analytical photogrammetry, digital photogrammetry, and has now entered the phase of high-resolution digital photogrammetry with the event of high-resolution cameras, remote sensing, drones, as well as supercomputers to process the acquired digital images (Figure 4). Digital photogrammetry is applied to digital images that can be scanned from photographs or directly captured by digital cameras. The output products are in digital form, such as digital maps, digital elevation models, digital ortho-images, and textural models.

This paper presents a new lightweight real-time onboard object tracking approach with multi-inertial sensing data, wherein a highly energy-efficient drone is built based on the Snapdragon flight board of Qualcomm. The flight board uses a digital signal processor core of the Snapdragon 801 processor to realize PX4 autopilot, an open-source autopilot system oriented toward inexpensive autonomous aircraft. It also uses an ARM core to realize Linux, robot operating systems, open-source computer vision library, and related algorithms. A lightweight moving object detection algorithm is proposed that extracts feature points in the video frame using the oriented FAST and rotated binary robust independent elementary features algorithm and adapts a local difference binary algorithm to construct the image binary descriptors. The K-nearest neighbor method is then used to match the image descriptors. Finally, an object tracking method is proposed that fuses inertial measurement unit data, global positioning system data, and the moving object detection results to calculate the relative position between coordinate systems of the object and the drone. All the algorithms are run on the Qualcomm platform in real time.

The spatiotemporal variability of the snowpack plays a critical role in local climate systems. Not only water management and ecology investigations, but also hazard prevention and risk evaluation generate a higher demand for information about snow surfaces. As critical areas are not accessible at certain periods, remote sensing technologies are strongly recommended. In this paper, we highlight the significance of using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for high-resolution snow mapping. We also concentrate on the challenges occurring when using the principles of photogrammetry on snow covered areas. Snow depth and its spatial distribution are important for a wide range of applications. Their regular and accurate determination is necessary especially for detecting notable short-term changes. Over time, various practices have been developed to monitor snow depth, each one presenting a set of advantages and limitations. UAVs have become particularly useful. Their use has shown considerable advantages compared with manned aircrafts, LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and manual snow surveys. By using photogrammetric techniques to process the imagery, Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of snow can be produced with one-decimetre horizontal and vertical accuracies. Nevertheless, snow constitutes a challenging surface. The accessibility of the area, the material transfer and the weather conditions constitute the first obstacles for the mapping mission. At the same time, the homogeneity of the snow surface and the extreme contrast between full-reflectance and shadow zones have an impact on the imagery. State-of-the-art airborne photogrammetry methods boost new investigations in the snow science community. Near-InfraRed imagery (NIR) has shown some potential to identify tie points. Furthermore, different procedures have been applied to classify and to extract the snow extent. In parallel, it is suggested to store images in raw formats in order to preserve the resolution. The proper calibration of the camera is also highly recommended. All the aforementioned challenges require the development of specific expertise. The flight planning including the choice of the camera must account for the light conditions. Finally, the lack of obvious patterns in the images may call for non-default settings during the data processing.

Much of this debate has centered on their use by governments, often for the purpose of surveillance and warfare. This focus on the state's use obscures the opportunity for civil society actors, including social movements, to make use of these technologies. This article briefly reviews the technological innovation before proceeding to a typology of civil society uses, ranging from art to digital disruption. This typology emphasizes the dual-use nature of this technology and, in the process, highlights the need for a best-practices framework to guide such use. Drone usage for the public good, it is argued, should prioritize 1) subsidiarity; 2) physical and material security; 3) the \"do no harm\" principle; 4) the public good; and respect for 5) privacy, and 6) data. These factors are introduced and discussed. ********** The recent wave of mobilization and contestation that has swept from Tunisia to Ukraine has run parallel to the emergence of an important technological innovation. (1) While the use of mobile phones and social media has received a large amount of attention, protests in Hong Kong, Ukraine, and even Ferguson, Missouri have seen the emergence of civil society's use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or, more commonly, \"drones.\" (2) This innovation represents a technological shift in scale for citizen journalists, human rights advocates, and social movement actors. As such, it requires a sophisticated assessment of the ethical issues and policy terrain surrounding its use. To date, debates over the use of UAVs have focused on two areas. First, human rights groups have mobilized against the state's use of drone strikes and the killing of civilians in the \"War on Terror.\" Second, policymakers in Europe and the United States have scrambled to regulate the commercial use of drones. However, a critical third segment of drone usage by and for civil society actors, especially social movements, deserves attention. This article reviews the nascent literature on UAV use and situates it within the larger theory and debates over technology and innovation, ethics, legal rights (including privacy and the right to information), public policy, and human rights. It then applies these considerations to proposed guidelines for the use of UAVs by non-state and non-commercial actors. (3) It concludes by noting the perils and promises of the use of drones for the purpose of investigative journalism, human rights monitoring, and state accountability. (4) The dual interest in the technology by both the state and its challengers points to the promise and peril of innovation. INNOVATION The promise and peril of UAVs lie at the intersection of three interconnected technological innovations. The first involves a shift from analog to digital devices. This allows for more powerful onboard processors, longer battery life, and the ability to easily stream audio and video to digital consumer devices. Combined with more stable quadcopter designs, these have transferred UAVs from the hobbyist market to the general public. But this shift from analog to digital also covers the payloads these devices carry. While the carrying capacity within consumer devices is modest, they are sufficient to carry cameras, as well as sophisticated signal-jamming equipment, wireless routers, and similar electronic devices. UAVs are an ideal type of innovation, that is, they combine invention with exploitation (by marketing, integrating, and diffusing goods and ideas). (5) Popular digital imaging devices represent a second technological scale shift, as they generate infinitely portable and reproducible images that can be shared, copied, distributed, and stored with increasing ease and decreasing cost. Combined with the emergence of online environs for storing and sharing images, digital imaging devices have fundamentally disrupted the status quo with regard to journalism, whether for entertainment, such as paparazzi photos of a Hollywood star, or accountability, such as YouTube footage from the Arab Spring. \u2026", "authors": ["A.

Combining insights from the theory of moral panics with pre-pandemic research on parents who refuse vaccines, I argue that to understand the high levels of concern about Covid-19 vaccines for children, we need a theory of \u201cmoral calms.\u201d Drawing on interviews with 80 mothers of young children whose vaccine decisions I have tracked since 2018, I find that early public health and media messaging created a \u201cmoral calm\u201d around children and Covid-19. These messages led many mothers\u2014particularly mothers who perceived their families as \u201cnaturally healthy\u201d\u2014to see their children as being at low risk of contracting, transmitting, and suffering serious consequences from Covid-19. As a result, many mothers came to see Covid-19 vaccines as unnecessary, even if they had previously vaccinated their children. Seeing vaccines as unnecessary then made mothers more susceptible to misinformation about Covid-19 vaccine risks and ultimately weakened their desire to vaccinate their children as soon as possible. I conclude that moral calms can, ironically, lay the groundwork for moral panics. By weakening people\u2019s concerns about a larger threat, they facilitate efforts to raise concerns about other smaller or nonexistent threats.

The indecision or skepticism surrounding vaccine acquisition (i.e., vaccine hesitancy, also known as \u201cantivax\u201d) is a vexing and complex phenomenon that dates to the late 1700s when Dr. Edward Jenner developed the smallpox vaccine, one of the greatest medical advances in history (Jarret et al., 2015; McAteer et al., 2020). In the 1900s, the incidence of vaccine-preventable infections, including several potentially fatal diseases, plummeted after the introduction of an array of highly effective vaccines. However, despite extensive experience demonstrating the safety of these life-saving vaccines, a segment of the population has remained firmly opposed to their use. A number of factors have been shown to contribute to vaccine hesitancy including a belief that there is reduced safety and a potential for long-term sequelae, a perception of low risk for disease acquisition, and distinct moral values (Dror et al., 2020; McAteer et al., 2020). Ironically, the success of vaccination may have contributed to the skepticism that currently exists with regard to vaccines (McAteer et al., 2020). For infectious diseases with low incidence due to vaccination, there may be a tendency to focus attention on the potential side effects of a vaccine\u2014rather than the potential negative impact of the disease that the vaccine prevents. Many of the \u201cusual childhood diseases\u201d of years past are so rarely seen, if at all, that they are considered an abstraction to much of the general public. In other words, if one has never witnessed or experienced the devastating impact of measles, for example, then one might not fully understand the importance of this vaccine\u2019s uptake. With regard to the currently available COVID-19 vaccines under emergency use authorization, skepticism and vaccine hesitancy is known to exist (McAteer et al., 2020). Experts, such as Dr. Anthony Fauci who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have stated that the COVID-19 pandemic could be \u201ccrushed\u201d through vaccination (Gordon, 2021). However, surveys have indicated that a significant number of individuals are declining the opportunity for COVID-19 vaccination. For example, in the U.S. military, one third of enlisted individuals are declining the COIVD-19 vaccine (New York Times, 2021). In another example, 39% of nurses in Israel (n 1\u20444 211) stated that they would not take a COVID-19 vaccine (Dror et al., 2020). The significant percentage of individuals who have declined, or who plan to decline, COVID-19 vaccination raises concern about the ability to reach herd immunity and end the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses are in a unique position to enhance COVID-19 vaccine uptake, given their ranking as the nation\u2019s most trusted professionals (Reinhart, 2020), together with their important role in the care of the victims of COVID-19. In order to inform strategies to enhance vaccine uptake, nurses can glean \u201ctakehome messages\u201d from previous vaccine uptake research that has been conducted. Successful interventions to improve vaccine uptake to levels higher than a 25% increase have included using multifaceted strategies, directly targeting unvaccinated and under-vaccinated groups, including a strategy to increase knowledge and awareness, enhancing convenience to access vaccination, and engaging faith or other influential community leaders in the strategy. The most effective strategies have occurred through the provision of interventions that are tailored to the priority population. Passive strategies, such as posters, have only minimally increased vaccine uptake (Jarret et al., 2015). Nurses can utilize what is known about effective vaccine uptake strategies and inform interventions and outreach programs in their own communities. Who better than a trusted nurse has the power, experience, and the skills to reach a community and provide the COVID-19 vaccine uptake message?

The Harvard group\u2019s models predict that a resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 could occur as late as 2024 after a period of apparent elimination, if the duration of immunity is intermediate and if other corona viruses induce intermediate cross-immunity. Among more than 60 vaccine candidates in clinical trials, currently, only the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna COVID-19, and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine has additionally received approval in the European countries, India, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Pakistan, Nepal, and others. For emergency use, other vaccines like Sputnik V, BBIBP-CorV, CoronaVac, Ad5-nCoV, EpiVacCorona, and BBV152 have been approved in many countries in the world. The approval of the vaccines has created some degree of confidence, and many countries have begun administering them. However, the accessibility of the vaccines to low-income countries (LICs) may be hindered, and thus, many concerned authorities have been questioned. It is because most of the vaccines have been reported to be reserved by wealthy nations. These issues are extensively reviewed by the Lancet Commission on COVID-19 Vaccines and Therapeutics Task Force Members. As of February 19, 2021, about 90 countries had access to at least one COVID-19 vaccine. Gibraltar and Israel had more than 78 cumulative COVID-19 vaccination doses administered per 100 people in this context. Compared to this, Cambodia, Pakistan, Mauritius, Albania, Ecuador, Guyana, and Bolivia had less than 0.1 doses administered. Until this period, ten countries that account for 60% of the global gross domestic product had administered 75% of all COVID-19 vaccines. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO Director-General, and Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director, have pointed out that there are 130 countries, with a total population of 2.5 billion, that are yet to administer a single dose. It is a pity that expert health workers are dying in sub-Saharan Africa, indicating an international moral failure in these regions although six hundred thousand doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India have recently reached in Ghana. In summary, most countries in Africa and a few in Asia and South America are in the risk groups for vaccine inaccessibility. Antonio Guterres, the Chief of the United Nations (UN), has stated that progress on COVID-19 vaccinations has been wildly uneven and unfair (https://twitter.com/antonioguterres). Scientists believe that this uneven pattern of inoculations could also lead to virus mutations and new vaccine-resistant variants. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the deaths and severe illness of many people and the disruption of normal lives, a loss of jobs, a loss of trade, and has dwindled the already weak national economies in the LICs. In this situation, equitable access to a suitable and effective vaccine, especially for the front-line workers, is critical for mitigating and maintaining public health systems and economic growth. That is why the demand for COVID-19 vaccines has been soaring, although supply has been limited. Many underlying causes of vaccine inequity exist in the LICs, which we now discuss in turn. First, many LICs have low socio-economic status with low levels of education, income, and occupation. These factors may directly affect the vaccine-purchasing and accepting processes of their people. Second, the geographical landscape of many LICs poses a significant challenge to vaccine distribution. Many high altitudinal landscapes within Hindu-Kush Himalayan regions, such as Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, make it very difficult for the vaccine campaigners and staff to distribute vaccines. The difficult situation might be worsened in the desert and remote areas engulfed in war, instability, and conflict. In this context, more than 160 million people have been estimated to be at risk of inaccessibility of the COVID-19 vaccine in Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, and Ethiopia. Third, people from urban slums and marginalized and migratory populations have poor access to immunization facilities. Vaccine distribution is challenging in urban and peri-urban slums that are overgrowing in developing countries. Fourth, most of the available COVID-19 vaccines need to be transported and stored at refrigerating to freezing temperatures, for example, the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine at 2\u20138 \u00b0C and the Pfizer vaccine at \u221270 \u00b0C, although new stability data submitted by the companies to the US regulator show that the latter vaccine can be stored at temperatures of \u221215 to \u221225 \u00b0C for up to 2 weeks. Even to protect their quality, care is still needed after transferring these vaccines to the refrigerator or following thawing. Strict regulations for temperature are critical for the maintenance of efficacy, potency, and stability of vaccines. These are significant challenges in LICs due to a shortage of cold chain infrastructures and a lack of advanced technology to monitor the cold chain for storage, distribution, and transportation of vaccines, especially in the rural regions. It could result in low immunization coverage in these areas and, subsequently, the probable endemicity of COVID-19 infections. Fifth, levels of vaccine hesitancy, fear, and confusion have been raised in many countries because of the range of data from efficacy trials for the same product. For example, the Sinovac, a Chinese company, showed 50\u201391% efficacy. Also, there is the apparent doubt whether the vaccines that have been designed and developed by the researchers following one year of the experiment will work against new variants of the virus.

The risk of infection and its consequences have changed the daily lives of billions of people, with an incalculable economic cost. The pandemic also led to an increased demand for medical and health care; therefore, it was necessary to create guidelines and protocols to indicate treatment priorities and which patients should be treated. Based on this issue, ethical and bioethical principles were raised and discussed. The \u2018\u2018welfare state\u2019\u2019 is a concept that covers the social, political, and economic areas and sees the state as an institution that is obligated to organize the economy and guarantee basic service access, such as health, education, and security to its citizens, thereby reducing social inequalities. The full functioning of a welfare state demands effective public policies, and the government must ensure that the rights of the population are maintained. In Brazil, one of these policies is the Unified Health System, one of the few health systems in the world that is completely free, regardless of nationality, socioeconomic status, household, or any other factor. This is a public policy in line with the idea of social welfare, as it uses public resources to provide health care to all residents in Brazil. The great difficulty in implementing and operating this system is the need for financial resources. Some theories hold that there is a moral reason for doing what is good for everyone. This can be called the principle of beneficence. Utilitarians, for example, argue that maximizing what is good for everyone is the ultimate expression of morality. However, some theories defend other principles that should be pursued and valued, without ignoring the issue of the difference between what is fair distribution and what is fair for all citizens of society; therefore, the principle of beneficence must be balanced with the principle of justice (1). The principle of autonomy values the people\u2019s freedom to choose and determine how to live their lives by themselves. It turns out that individual freedoms may conflict with the general good; this occurs, for example, when citizens disrespect social distancing or when they demand a resource that is scarce and insufficient for everyone for themselves and their families. At this point, it is important to reflect on whether the principle of beneficence should be impartial, providing resources for the good of all, or whether it should be allowed to provide more to those who are close to us. In the context of the pandemic, is it reasonable to assume impartiality? During a pandemic, a situation in which health systems are experiencing massive challenges, and there is an indisputable need to prioritize the necessity of some citizens, it is not necessary to talk about egalitarianism, as it is impossible to treat all citizens equally. Moreover, it is a mistake not to consider that some actions can generate serious consequences, such as the avoidable loss of many lives, or the ethics of the best way to do the general good. Several practical rules can guide quick decision-making in such a situation. A rule of utilitarianism is to save as many people as possible, using a screening mechanism: (i) treatment duration; (ii) life expectancy and, indirectly, the patient\u2019s age; (iii) quality of life, i.e., not only how long the patient will live, but how well they will live; (iv) social wellbeing, so that it is relevant to consider not only the individual benefit for the patient directly benefiting from a conduct, but also the benefit that the person receiving the treatment may offer to other individuals; and, especially, (v) the available financial resources versus the cost of each treated patient, as the more resources that are spent on a single treatment, the fewer resources will be available for others (1). Over the decades, history has taught us lessons about vaccine-preventable diseases in pregnancy. The recognition of the specific conditions of pregnancy and puerperium and the unique consequences of diseases during pregnancy has enabled the development of safe vaccines capable of greatly improving maternal and perinatal prognoses. The use of vaccines during pregnancy benefits not only the pregnant woman but also the fetus and the newborn; thus, vaccines are beneficial in pregnancy for (i) preventing maternal morbidity and mortality; (ii) reducing the risk of fetal infection; and (iii) providing passive immunity to the newborn. Therefore, it is necessary to redouble efforts in public health involvement and education to optimize vaccination and value its benefits for maternal and perinatal health (2).

We, the consortium of the editors of the nation\u2019s major geriatric and gerontology journals, offer this perspective as a way to raise awareness about ageism in association with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to acknowledge the extraordinary work that healthcare providers across all disciplines, including geriatrics, are doing at the frontlines of care. We also offer these thoughts as advocates for older patients, their families, their providers, and the broader community. COVID-19 transited the world with staggering speed, which speaks to the fact that the world is borderless when it comes to a virulent 50\u2013200 nanometer mRNA virus. Initially, our nation\u2019s response to the pandemic was slow and poorly coordinated. Political and personal interests superseded evidence-based public health practices. Fortunately, steady and consistent efforts by teams of scientists and public health officials, and the visible impact of the illness in communities, have changed the narrative and nationwide response. To be sure, significant challenges with our healthcare and public health systems remain, and include supply-chain shortages, insufficient hospital bed capacity, poor public engagement with preventive measures, and lengthy treatment and vaccine development. We have been struck, however, by the emergence of an ageist bias towards older adults as part of the response and public discourse. For example, our colleague, Dr. Louise Aronson, in a sobering commentary in The Atlantic wrote about ageism making the pandemic worse, pointed out how differently we might be acting if COVID-19 put young people, as opposed to older people, at more risk. She pointed out ageist comments such as COVID-19 being \u201cBoomer removers\u201d and perceptions about older adults as being irresponsible, and contrasted these observations with the more empathic actions taken by responsible businesses such as grocery stores that offered reserved hours for older customers. Her most challenging reflection, however, was her medical center\u2019s initial lack of developing specific prevention and management protocols for older adults. We recognize the emerging thorny ethical and moral challenges that our frontline colleagues are beginning to face.

COVID-19 has revealed significant inadequacies in the nation\u2019s supply of ventilators necessary for respiratory support for patients in extreme respiratory distress. How, then, should decisions be made as to who should or should not be afforded access to them? Is the battlefield triage analogy applicable\u2014 meaning categorizing patients as healthy enough to survive without a ventilator; likely to die even with a respirator; high likely of survival if a ventilator is used? If this strategy is employed, an unavoidable question is the extent to which age of the patient should be considered in the decision. Such issues have already arisen in Italy, and all to easily age was advanced as the criterion for decision making rather than developing more nuanced approaches, as proposed by White and Lo. The need to make such decisions, should it arise, will create not only ethical conundrums, but also conditions for moral injury for providers who may already be experiencing burn-out and perhaps loss of their own family members. Fortunately, many prognostic models in medicine demonstrate that age is but one of many factors in triage decisions such as this. Still, front line clinicians and families will face numerous care decisions that require multiple probabilistic judgments where guidelines may not be clear. These situations require the valued participation of interprofessional teams, in collaboration with the patient (if capable) and families, in order to bring about better decisions\u2014tough though they may be. Experts in geriatric medicine and healthcare bring a critical informed voice to this decision-making. Society\u2019s diminished valuation of individuals as they age is a continuing thread within ageism. Tackling ageism in this pandemic requires evidence that contravenes these preconceived notions, and we offer two examples as evidence\u2014the value of wisdom and personal resilience.

Due to the prolongation of the pandemic, people are less likely to follow health protocols. The British version of the virus (B.1.1.7) has spread across the country, raising concerns about causing a national catastrophe. Between 400 and 500 people die every day in the country due to COVID-19, which is a high figure considering the population of 80 million people in Iran.3 Vaccination of citizens in Iran began in February 2021 with a limited number of Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccines. However, the total number of vaccines that arrived in Iran three months later was less than 900,000 doses. Many other promises made by officials have so far relied on an agreement or registration of an order and request for vaccine, which has often failed to materialize.4 In terms of vaccinating citizens, Iran lags far behind (with the exception of a few countries in the region, such as Afghanistan) and has not taken the first steps compared to a country like Turkey with an almost identical population. In Turkey, more than 20 million doses of vaccine were injected by April 2021, while this number in Iran did not exceed 718,510 doses by the end of April 2021.5 Iran has high hopes for joint production of vaccines to meet domestic demand. Another such vaccine is scheduled to enter the third phase of a clinical trial soon in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute of Iran (Tehran, Iran) and the Cuban Finlay Institute (Playa, Havana, Cuba). Also, phase one of the Barakat vaccine has entered the clinical trial phase in the ethics committee due to providing the necessary documents after examinations, and a number of Chinese Sinofarm COVID-19 vaccines, Indian Bharat Biotech COVID-19 vaccines, and Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines have also been imported into the country. Medical staff are given first priority in receiving the vaccine, and the next priority includes high-risk groups such as the elderly and people with underlying diseases. All vaccines that were initially imported into the country are to be injected into first-line health care workers and medical staff at medical centers. However, due to the formation of the fourth wave of COVID-19 in the country, not all health care workers have been vaccinated yet. Besides, most people who have been vaccinated have received only one dose of the vaccine.6 The COVID-19 vaccine in Iran faces several fundamental challenges among the medical staff, including economic and political sanctions. For example, The Washington Post (Washington, DC USA) quoted financial and business analysts as saying that economic sanctions against Iran could disrupt the country\u2019s access to the COVID-19 vaccine, thus thwarting Iran\u2019s efforts to control the pandemic and perpetuating the prevalence of this disease in the region.7 Although the spokesman for the global COVID-19 vaccine program, called \u201cCOVAX,\u201d says the United States has exempted deals related to the vaccine from sanctions, analysts warn that financial sanctions will limit Iran\u2019s efforts to participate in the program, as well as the purchase of medical items. However, ensuring that international companies can deliver these vaccines to Iran requires redoubled efforts and targeted measures. With regard to political issues, Iran has restrictions on the import of the COVID-19 vaccine due to its special political ties. In January 2021, the Iranian leader banned American and British vaccines from entering the country for political reasons. 1.

As a consequence the South African government imposed hard lockdown measures (level 3) as a means to curb the pandemic. Governments around the world are scrambling to obtain and roll-out Covid-19 vaccination programs to save lives and livelihoods. Most developed countries have initiated inoculations, amid widespread misinformation and hesitancy. Literature indicate that healthcare professionals (HCPs) are generally complacent and hesitant about vaccination. The COVID-19 uptake is likely to be suboptimal among HCPs and the general populations. The voluntary immunization program will commence in February 2021, and the Healthcare professionals will be among the first to be vaccinated. It remains to be seen if this cohort will achieve the desired vaccinations rates. Failure for this influential group to vaccinate could derail the program and lead to failure to achieve herd immunity. In the face of emerging vaccine hesitancy among HCPs, should oral health professionals be compelled to vaccinate? Will any refusal by OHPs to be immunized be morally justified? Oral health professionals in this context of this paper, represent all oral health professionals involved in the management dental patients. No singular ethical framework is held as sufficient to resolve these questions. This paper interrogates aspect of clinical ethics, including the Hippocratic Oath, principilism, public health ethics (Utilitarianism) and Kantian deontology,\u00a0to tackle the questions raised.

In contrast, significant numbers of South Africans did not have the financial means to physically distance nor the kinds of employment that could simply be moved to their residences. As in the United States, we have seen unemployment levels rise, hospitals bursting at the seams, and our universities trying to manage the move to online teaching. Near the end of 2020, a glimmer of hope emerged in the form of vaccines. These very vaccines, however, have generated new tensions between countries and raise complicated moral situations for those who produce research about the continent. \u201cVaccinenationalism\u201d is a term that has quickly entered our vocabularies. In December, when the first COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the UK, here in South Africa it was not clear if anyone would be able to receive a vaccine in the first half of 2021. Luckily, our government, through multilateralmechanisms such asCovax and theAfricanUnion, in addition to bilateral negotiations with vaccine producers, has managed to subsequently procure a substantial number of doses. The first vaccinations for front line health workers were rolled out starting in mid-February 2021. In January 2021, the Economist Intelligence Unit projected that South Africa would achieve sufficient vaccine coverage by mid-2022\u2014it would, however, be the only African country to do so. The rest of the continent is only expected to achieve sufficient coverage between late 2022 and early 2023.

The advantages and disadvantages of different methods when dealing with a specific problem are also discussed. Obtained clean images or pure signals can be used for further data analysis.

Differently from the traditional advertising paradigm, these posts feature not only specific products, but also the value and philosophy of the brand, known as brand associations in marketing literature. In fact, marketers are spending considerable resources to generate their content in-house, and increasingly often, to discover and repost the content generated by users. However, to choose the right posts for a brand in social media remains an open problem. Driven by this real-life application, we define the new task of content discovery for brands, which aims to discover posts that match the marketing value and brand associations of a target brand. We identify two main challenges in this new task: high inter-brand similarity and brand-post sparsity; and propose a tailored content-based learning-to-rank system to discover content for a target brand. Specifically, our method learns fine-grained brand representation via explicit modeling of brand associations, which can be interpreted as visual words shared among brands. We collected a new large-scale Instagram dataset, consisting of more than 1.1 million image and video posts from the history of 927 brands of fourteen verticals such as food and fashion.

Different from traditional advertising, these posts are not restricted to the products or logo but include visual elements that express more in general the values and attributes of the brand, called brand associations. Since marketers are increasingly spending time in discovering and re-posting user generated posts that reflect the brand attributes, there is an increasing demand for such discovery systems. The goal of these systems is to assist brand experts in filtering through online collections of new user media to discover actionable posts, which match the brand value and have the potential to engage the consumers. Driven by this real-life application, we define and formulate a new task of content discovery for brands and propose a framework that learns to rank posts for brands from their historical timeline. We design a Personalized Content Discovery (PCD) framework to address the three challenges of high inter-brand similarity, sparsity of brand--post interactions, and diversification of timeline. To learn fine-grained brand representation and to generate explanations for the ranking, we automatically learn visual elements of posts from the timeline of brands and from a set of brand attributes in the domain of marketing.

There has recently been a growth in sensitivity toward pet animals, and this has also involved an increase in attention toward their nutrition, which is seen as a way of guaranteeing the welfare of their pets. However, it is difficult for pet owners to understand the quality of products, due to a lack of clear information on the label. The aim of the study has been to identify the pet food characteristics that can be considered as quality indicators for dog and cat owners through a survey which was distributed by the promoters in pet stores and sector fairs throughout the Italian territory. Results. A total of 935 surveys were collected. Descriptive statistic showed a higher percentage of female owners (61.8%) among the interviewees. The participants were divided almost equally between owners of dogs (39.4%), cats (30.8%) and both dogs and cats (29.8%). A quarter of the owners (25.5%) asked veterinary for advice on which pet food to buy, and about a third (30.4%) trusted the advice posted on web sites\u2019 of the major brands\u2019, giving both of them a greater responsibility to provide information. \u201cContains natural ingredients\u201d was the characteristic with the highest score (4.3 out of 5). Older owners (>65y) paid more attention to cost, and less to the appearance of pet food, animal satisfaction and fecal quality. Younger owners (<35y) paid more attention to the quality of the faeces, the percentage of protein, the presence of recyclable packaging and less attention to the appearance of the food, the smell and animal satisfaction. Appearance, smell, a higher cost and some label indications (protein content, presence of fresh meat, grain-free) were important for the wet pet food buyers. Furthermore, some differences emerged between the owners of different animal species. Conclusions. Italian pet food buyers considered the presence of particular ingredients as the most important indicator of quality of pet food, while the least important was the price.

Despite this, various aspects of the cranial anatomy of Allosaurus are surprisingly poorly understood. Here, we discuss the osteology of the cheek region, comprised by the jugal, maxilla, and lacrimal.

The bizarre variety of skulls and lower jaw morphologies as well as the inferred ecological abundance of many species in this clade indicate that Ceratopsia was a successful group. Here we analyzed 126 lower jaws from 50 ceratopsian species, using two-dimensional geometric morphometrics and finite element analysis to investigate differences in shape and structural performance of this part of the feeding apparatus across Ceratopsia. Morphological differences in lower jaws across ceratopsian clades are said to originate from feeding adaptation. Our results show that the stress (physical loadings modeled in response to biting) in lower jaws was quite similar between \u201cbasal\u201d and \u201cderived\u201d taxa, whereas major differences among clades occur for stress values associated with the coronoid process. The basal ceratopsians Hualianceratops and Yinlong had a highly stressed and primitive lower jaw, indicating that those animals may have fed on relatively soft foliage and fruits. A similar condition was found for basal neoceratopsians and protoceratopsids. Psittacosaurids possessed a well-integrated and compact lower jaw able to withstand high stress, at the cost of having a highly stressed coronoid process. Leptoceratopsids were characterized by the opposite condition. Taxa such as Leptoceratops, Prenoceratops, Zhuchengceratops and Cerasinops appear to have had a comparatively efficient feeding apparatus. Ceratopsidae represents the clade with the most efficient masticatory apparatus within Ceratopsia, even if the horizontal ramus of the lower jaw appears less able to withstand high levels of stress as compared with other ceratopsians. Additionally, we found the dentary and surangular\u2013angular complex co-evolved to generate a masticatory apparatus able to withstand high stress, particularly in Protoceratopsidae and Triceratopsini.

Even institutions with no active research in the Mesozoic dutifully exhibit a Tyrannosaurus skull cast, and many of today\u2019s paleontologists credit their career path at least in part to an early glimpse of dinosaur skeletons. The educational impact of these exhibits cannot be overemphasized, and thus it was a great joy to learn of the reopening of the Dinosaur Hall at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in July 2011. By simple virtue of their location within one of North America\u2019s most populous urban centers, the exhibits have the potential to influence and inspire the public for decades to come. During a busy weekday in December 2011, I had the opportunity to see these exhibits in person. As visual spectacle alone, the Dinosaur Hall is wildly successful. Natural light streams into the 14,000 square feet of galleries from all angles, and colorful, beautifully accurate murals of Mesozoic scenes fill several of the walls. And the skeletal mounts\u2014what a treat! Every last one has a dynamic feel, whether in a solo or group tableau. The mount hardware is unobtrusive and artful, and it is very easy to view most of the mounts from multiple angles. Virtually no barriers obstruct the views of the full-skeletal mounts, but I got the sense that a low, unobtrusive railing would save the staff much headache. The conservator in me felt uneasy watching some parents try to hoist their toddlers onto the base of the T. rex platform for a better photo opportunity. However, I can hardly blame the public for wanting a closer look\u2014the trio of Tyrannosaurus fills the center of the gallery and beautifully portrays a growth series from juvenile to adult, caught in the act of feeding on a hadrosaur carcass. The associated signage engages the visitor in an accessible discussion of allometry, individual variation, and ontogeny, along with the various lines of evidence paleontologists use to reconstruct such things. Spatially, the exhibit hall is divided into three parts\u2014two large ground level galleries and a mezzanine spanning the two rooms. The designers did an excellent job with introductory signage and content organization at all entry points, so that the exhibits make sense no matter where visitors start. The first of the ground level galleries is dominated by a cast skeleton of the Chinese Jurassic sauropod Mamenchisaurus, as well as a beautiful real-bone mount of the North American Cretaceous ceratopsid Triceratops. Smaller skeletons dispersed throughout this area illustrate additional diversity. A \u2018wall of bones\u2019 impresses visitors with the sheer variety of dinosaur fossils, although labeling in this case is accessible only through an often-crowded computer monitor. This digital-only format is fortunately restricted to that exhibit, and individual specimen labels elsewhere are easily located and understood. At the other end of this exhibit gallery, the visitor passes beside and beneath some spectacular mounts of Mesozoic marine life. The second main gallery features a menagerie of dinosaurs, including a block of Coelophysis, the above-mentioned Tyrannosaurus, a bevy of horned dinosaur heads, Stegosaurus and Allosaurus locked in conflict, and much more. Original fossil material dominates (and is well labeled as such), and many of the over 300 specimens have never been previously exhibited or are remounted in light of the latest information. The mezzanine epitomizes the prevailing theme of the Dinosaur Hall\u2014what do we know about dinosaur biology, and how do we know it? The intertwined roles of histology, geology, and comparative anatomy, to name just a few, are explored through hands-on interactive displays coupled with video presentations and computer terminals. Visitors can touch an ontogenetic sequence of tyrannosaur femora, peer into a histological section, and then peel away the layers of bone on a replica to understand how paleontologists estimate the ages of dinosaurs. One of my very favorite exhibits focused on the scientific process behind understanding Argentina\u2019s sauropod nesting sites. Refreshingly, the display broke the standard, oversimplified mold of \u201cask a question, formulate a hypothesis, design an experiment\u201d presented at most science museums. Instead, the important role of serendipity\u2014finding the unexpected and following up on it with additional research\u2014was given top billing. An engaged museum visitor would undoubtedly come away with a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the scientific process, and even a casual attendee should learn the basics behind reconstructing extinct life. This emphasis on scientific process is important, but as presented here has only one major drawback. The exhibits make abundantly clear that dinosaurs and their aquatic counterparts were living, breathing animals, but in what context? Many of the most eye-catching sections in the Hall of Dinosaurs feel as if they\u2019ve been yanked out of space and time, with little sense for how the organisms fit within their ancient ecosystems or the tree of life. A welcome exception is a small side exhibit that nicely touches on some of the other members of Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems (the little lizard and crocodyliform specimens from the Morrison Formation are particularly breathtaking!). Unfortunately, I fear that this bigger perspective is too easily missed or ignored by the average visitor. Indeed, I noticed many people walking right by the ecological displays without a glance. A further by-product of this de-emphasis on the broader picture is that the evolutionary and ecological connection of our modern world to the Mesozoic one is obscured. The bird-dinosaur link is rightfully and prominently shown, but there is precious little else to establish the relevance of Deep Time to the present. A casual visitor may come away with the unfortunate impression that a bunch of big animals lived long ago, died out, and then our modern world popped into being. Only the few who dig deeper in the exhibits will be rewarded with a more complete understanding. A successful exhibit hall is more than just the skeletons and interpretive text; educational staff and volunteers also serve a major role in informing and exciting the public. On the day of my visit, it was a real treat to see this kind of outreach in action. The staff\u2019s genuine enthusiasm for the subject and willingness to engage with the public by answering questions, pointing out specimens on displays to illustrate a point, and passing around real fossils, undoubtedly had a major positive impact for many visitors.

In British Columbia, fossils have long been uncovered from the prevalent mid-Cambrian Burgess Shale, but few deposits date from the Mesozoic, and few of these are dinosaurian. The purpose of this paper is to review the history of dinosaurian body fossils in British Columbia. The following dinosaur groups are represented: ankylosaurians, hadrosaurids, pachycephalosaurids, ornithomimosaurians, dromaeosaurids and tyrannosaurids. Introduction The first fossil excavations from British Columbia, Canada, were begun in 1909, when Charles Doolittle Walcott uncovered a deposit near the town of Field (Gould, 1989). This deposit, of Cambrian fauna, is located at Yoho National Park within the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, and was designated as a World Heritage Site in 1984 (Morris & Whittington, 1985). Though the Burgess Shale preserves many fossils of extinct organisms, the deposit predates dinosaurs by more than a quarter of a billion years, at about 508 million years old (Butterfield, 2006). In British Columbia, there are many formations during the Mesozoic, nearly all of which preserve dinosaurian traces, such as footprints, with a few also preserving pterosaurian traces (McCrea et al., 2014). However, dinosaur bones were unheard of in British Columbia until 1971, when bones, including part of an arm and a leg from a derived ornithischian, were discovered in the north of the province (Arbour & Graves, 2008). However, dinosaur bones remained exceptionally rare until the early 2000s, when large deposits near the town of Tumbler Ridge were discovered (Arbour & Graves, 2008). Most recently, a nearly complete hadrosaur was discovered in the Tumbler Ridge deposits, which marks the most complete find in the province. Along with the hadrosaur are also the first potential tyrannosaur and dromeosaur teeth (IJR, pers. obs.). This is different from other western regions of North America, especially Alberta, where many hundreds or thousands of specimens have been discovered in Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits, with only minimal track or other trace fossils.

Discussion: Based on the presence of a single scute clearly from an ankylosaurian, there was at least one taxon of ankylosaurian present in the Tumbler Ridge area of northeastern B.C. (McCrea & Buckley, 2004). As only a single scute is known, not much anatomical information can be identified beyond an ankylosaurian identity. Thus, while being noted in McCrea & Buckley (2004), it is unlikely any following publications with be made regarding this scute. However, based on the location and age of this scute, is it possible it belongs to a nodosaurid, as ankylosaurids were only present much later in nearby Alberta.

Discussion: While disarticulated, and spread throughout several blocks, the material of an ornithopod is relatively complete compared to other fossils found in the deposit. The phalanx was not specified to a limb by McCrea & Buckley (2004), but the presence of a nearby fibula would make it likely it was from the pes. In addition, the possible pelvic bone (McCrea & Buckley, 2004, fig. 5a), corresponds strongly with the ischium of other ornithischians.

This material is among the other Tumbler Ridge fossils currently undergoing preparation and description (Rylaarsdam et al., 2006). The ischium of this specimen appears to be unique among other hadrosaurids in general, as the pubic peduncle is strongly reduced, so that the pubis would be contributing to the entire ventral edge of the acetabulum, and the ischium would only participate in the posterior edge. A general reduction in the pubic peduncle can be seen throughout Hadrosauroidea, although no taxa yet have it as reduced in this specimen. The shaft of the ischium gently curves dorsally, as found in Kundurosaurus and Edmontosaurus. However, the distal end of the ischial shaft is not preserved, and thus it cannot be identified if the specimen possesses a ventral curve and expansion, characteristic of Lambeosaurinae.

Location: Quality Creek canyon, Wapiti Formation, Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia (~73 mya; Fig. 1a). Discussion: Not much will be said about this specimen, apart from it has been proposed to be a new taxon of lambeosaurine, for this specimen is currently under preparation and is to be studied on (McCrea, pers. comm.). The specimen has not been described or figured in published literature, and cannot be certainly assigned to either Hadrosaurinae or Lambeosaurinae at this moment.

Location: Brothers Peak Formation, Sustut Basin, British Columbia (~72 mya; Fig. 1b). Discussion: Arbour & Graves (2008) provided a description of RBCM.EH.2006.019 that does not need to be replicated here, however, there are some points that warrant reconsidering, and other important features, which are quoted here. \u201cSeveral bones recovered by Larsen cannot be identified at this time. One of these is an extremely thin and flat bone, 98 mm long and 33 mm wide, with thicknesses ranging from 6 to 15 mm (Arbour & Graves, 2008 Fig. 2G-H). It is strongly curved in several directions. Identification of this bone is difficult because it is broken on almost every edge, but, based on its thin, curved shape, this fragment may represent a bone from the skull (Arbour & Graves, 2008: pp. 459\u2013460).\u201d PeerJ Preprints | https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.1369v3 | CC BY 4.0 Open Access | rec: 27 Jul 2016, publ: 27 Jul 2016 This bone, while potentially belonging to the skull roof, clearly lacks the rugose texture in other pachycephalosaurids, and is only gently curved. Based on the shape, and thickening of the posterior edge, it aligns more closely with the proximal end of the scapula, with a thickened coracoid articulation, and an even thicker glenoid. \u201cA bone fragment 78 mm long, 32 mm wide, and 7 to 22 mm thick represents an unidentifiable element (Arbour & Graves, 2008 Fig. 2E-F). One end of the fragment has a triangular outline with a pronounced notch, whereas the other end is thin and flattened. The long axis of the fragment is bowed. This element may be a fragment of a rib, but if so, it probably does not belong to the same individual as the rest of the bones as it is much larger than would be expected (Arbour & Graves, 2008: p. 460).\u201d While being proposed as the rib of a separate individual, this bone also appears similar to the distal blade of an ischium. The slight curvature is likely facing medially, and a slight anterior expansion is present. Also, if interpreted as an ischium, it fits within the size expected for RBCM.EH.2006.019, and as all other material can be assigned to the same individual without major issues, this ischium would follow suit. The most important feature of this specimen is the presence of an anteroposterior bowing of the distal end of the tibia (Arbour & Graves, 2008 Fig. 2R). This feature is not present in any other ornithischians, with the closest comparison a mediolateral bowing in the tibia of Zalmoxes (Arbour & Graves, 2008). This feature, not being attributable to post-mortem crushing, is thus autapomorphic of the specimen, and potentially warrants a new taxon. However, as no cranial material is known, it cannot readily be distinguished from ot", "authors": ["I. Reid"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2016}, "7": {"title": "Megalodon", "abstract": "In 1999, the TV movie Shark Attack depicted an attack by mutant great white sharks on the population of Cape Town. By the time the third entry in the series, Shark Attack 3, aired in 2002, mutant great whites had lost their lustre and were replaced as antagonists with the megalodon: a giant shark originating not in any laboratory, but history, having lived from approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago. The megalodon was resurrected again in May 2021 through a trifecta of events. A video of a basking shark encounter in the Atlantic went viral on the social media platform TikTok, due to users misidentifying it as a megalodon caught on tape. At the same time a boy received publicity for finding a megalodon tooth on a beach in South Carolina on his fifth birthday (Scott). And finally, the video game Stranded Deep, in which a megalodon is featured as a major enemy, was released as one of the monthly free games on the PlayStation Plus gaming service.\nThese examples form part of a larger trend of alleged megalodon sightings in recent years, emerging as a component of the modern resurgence of cryptozoology. In the words of Bernard Heuvelmans, the Belgian zoologist who both popularised the term and was a leading figure of the field, cryptozoology is the \u201cscience of hidden animals\u201d, which he further explained were\n\nmore generally referred to as \u2018unknowns\u2019, even though they are typically known to local populations\u2014at least sufficiently so that we often indirectly know of their existence, and certain aspects of their appearance and behaviour. It would be better to call them animals \u2018undescribed by science,\u2019 at least according to prescribed zoological rules. (1-2)\n\nIn other words, a large aspect of cryptozoology as a field is taking the legendary creatures of non-Western mythology and finding materialist explanations for them compatible with Western biology. In many ways, this is a relic of the era of European imperialism, when many creatures of Africa and the Americas were \u201chidden animals\u201d to European eyes (Dendle 200-01; Flores 557; Guimont). A major example of this is Bigfoot beliefs, a large subset of which took Native American legends about hairy wild men and attempted to prove that they were actually sightings of relict Gigantopithecus. These \u201chidden animals\u201d\u2014Bigfoot, Nessie, the chupacabra, the glawackus\u2014are referred to as \u2018cryptids\u2019 by cryptozoologists (Regal 22, 81-104).\nAlmost unique in cryptozoology, the megalodon is a cryptid based entirely on Western scientific development, and even the notion that it survives comes from standard scientific analysis (albeit analysis which was later superseded). Much like living mammoths and Bigfoot, what might be called the \u2018megalodon as cryptid hypothesis\u2019 serves to reinforce a fairy tale of its own. It reflects the desire to believe that there are still areas of the Earth untouched enough by human destruction to sustain massive animal life (Dendle 199-200). Indeed, megalodon\u2019s continued existence would help absolve humanity for the oceanic aspect of the Sixth Extinction, by its role as an alternative apex predator; cryptozoologist Michael Goss even proposed that whales and giant squids are rare not from human causes, but precisely because megalodons are feeding on them (40). Horror scholar Michael Fuchs has pointed out that shark media, particularly the 1975 film Jaws and its 2006 video game adaptation Jaws Unleashed, are imbued with eco-politics (Fuchs 172-83). These connections, as well as the modern megalodon\u2019s surge in popularity, make it notable that none of Syfy\u2019s climate change-focused Sharknado films featured a megalodon.\nDespite the lack of a Megalodonado, the popular appeal of the megalodon serves as an important case study. Given its scientific origin and dynamic relationship with popular culture, I argue that the \u2018megalodon as cryptid hypothesis\u2019 illustrates how the boundaries between \u2018hard\u2019 science and mythology, fiction and reality, as well as \u2018monster\u2019 and \u2018animal\u2019, are not as firm as advocates of the Western science tradition might believe. As this essay highlights, science can be a mythology of its own, and monsters can serve as its gods of the gaps\u2014or, in the case of megalodon, the god of the depths.\nMegalodon Fossils: A Short History\nAncient peoples of various cultures likely viewed fossilised teeth of megalodons in the area of modern-day Syria (Mayor, First Fossil Hunters 257). Over the past 2500 years, Native American cultures in North America used megalodon teeth both as curios and cutting tools, due to their large size and serrated edges. A substantial trade in megalodon teeth fossils existed between the cultures inhabiting the areas of the Chesapeake Bay and Ohio River Valley (Lowery et al. 93-108). A 1961 study found megalodon teeth present as offerings in pre-Columbian temples across Central America, including in the Mayan city of Palenque in Mexico and Sitio Conte in Panama (de Borhegyi 273-96). But these cases led to no mythologies incorporating megalodons, in contrast to examples such as the Unktehi, a Sioux water monster of myth likely inspired by a combination of mammoth and mosasaur fossils (Mayor, First Americans 221-38).\u00a0\nIn early modern Europe, megalodon teeth were initially referred to as \u2018tongue stones\u2019, due to their similarity in size and shape to human tongues\u2014just one of many ways modern cryptozoology comes from European religious and mystical thought (Dendle 190-216). In 1605, English scholar Richard Verstegan published his book A Restitution of Decayed Intelligence in Antiquities, which included an engraving of a tongue stone, making megalodon teeth potentially the subject of the first known illustration of any fossil (Davidson 333). In Malta, from the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries, megalodon teeth, known as \u2018St. Paul\u2019s tongue\u2019, were used as charms to ward off the evil eye, dipped into drinks suspected of being poisoned, and even ground into powder and consumed as medicine (Zammit-Maempel, \u201cEvil Eye\u201d plate III; Zammit-Maempel, \u201cHandbills\u201d 220; Freller 31-32).\nWhile megalodon teeth were valued in and of themselves, they were not incorporated into myths, or led to a belief in megalodons still being extant. Indeed, save for their size, megalodon teeth were hard to distinguish from those of living sharks, like great whites. Instead, both the identification of megalodons as a species, and the idea that they might still be alive, were notions which originated from extrapolations of the results of nineteenth and twentieth century European scientific studies. In particular, the major culprit was the famous British 1872-76 HMS Challenger expedition, which led to the establishment of oceanography as a branch of science.\nIn 1873, Challenger recovered fossilised megalodon teeth from the South Pacific, the first recovered in the open ocean (Shuker 48; Goss 35; Roesch). In 1959, the zoologist Wladimir Tschernezky of Queen Mary College analysed the teeth recovered by the Challenger and argued (erroneously, as later seen) that the accumulation of manganese dioxide on its surface indicated that one had to have been deposited within the last 11,000 years, while another was given an age of 24,000 years (1331-32). However, these views have more recently been debunked, with megalodon extinction occurring over two million years ago at the absolute latest (Pimiento and Clements 1-5; Coleman and Huyghe 138; Roesch).\nTschernezky\u2019s 1959 claim that megalodons still existed as of 9000 BCE was followed by the 1963 book Sharks and Rays of Australian Seas, a posthumous publication by ichthyologist David George Stead. Stead recounted a story told to him in 1918 by fishermen in Port Stephens, New South Wales, of an encounter with a fully white shark in the 115-300 foot range, which Stead argued was a living megalodon. That this account came from Stead was notable as he held a PhD in biology, had founded the Wildlife Preservation Society of Australia, and had debunked an earlier supposed sea monster sighting in Sydney Harbor in 1907 (45-46). The Stead account formed the backbone of cryptozoological claims for the continued existence of the megalodon, and after the book\u2019s publication, multiple reports of giant shark sightings in the Pacific from the 1920s and 1930s were retroactively associated with relict megalodons (Shuker 43, 49; Coleman and Huyghe 139-40; Goss 40-41; Roesch).\nA Monster of Science and Culture\nAs I have outlined above, the \u2018megalodon as cryptid hypothesis\u2019 had as its origin story not in Native American or African myth, but Western science: the Challenger Expedition, a London zoologist, and an Australian ichthyologist. Nor was the idea of a living megalodon necessarily outlandish; in the decades after the Challenger Expedition, a number of supposedly extinct fish species had been discovered to be anything but. In the late 1800s, the goblin shark and frilled shark, both considered \u2018living fossils\u2019, had been found in the Pacific (Goss 34-35). In 1938, the coelacanth, also believed by Western naturalists to have been extinct for millions of years, was rediscovered (at least by Europeans) in South Africa, samples having occasionally been caught by local fishermen for centuries. The coelacanth in particular helped give scientific legitimacy to the idea, prevalent for decades by that point, that living dinosaurs\u2014associated with a legendary creature called the mokele-mbembe\u2014might still exist in the heart of Central Africa (Guimont). In 1976, a US Navy ship off Hawaii recovered a megamouth shark, a deep-water species completely unknown prior.

Researchers headed by Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University have claimed to have found soft tissues in dinosaur fossils 68 million years old (Schweitzer, et al. 2005). This finding has caused a sensation and aroused tremendous controversy, since it is \u201ca matter of faith among scientists that soft tissue can survive at most for a few tens of thousands of years, not the 65 million since T. rex walked what\u2019s now the Hell Creek Formation in Montana\u201d (Yeoman 2006: 37). Nevertheless, Schweitzer has gained the support of some paleontologists, including the eminent dinosaur expert John R. \u201cJack\u201d Horner of the Museum of the Rockies, and Jan Toporski of the Carnegie Institution (both co-authors of the Science article). On the other hand, some scientists have insisted that the soft-tissue discoveries cannot be possible, and that they can be explained as outside contamination, or improper or incomplete testing of the samples (Yeoman 2006: 40). Apart from the data and their analysis, it has been interesting to see the behavior of scientists when confronted with information that may overturn a scientific \u201cdogma\u201d (an oxymoron) that they have been taught to believe is immutable. Schweitzer reports that \u201cI had one reviewer tell me that he didn\u2019t care what the data said, he knew that what I was finding wasn\u2019t possible. I wrote back and said, \u2018Well, what data would convince you?\u2019 And he said, \u2018None\u2019\u201d (Ibid, p. 37). Horner adds, \u201cFrequently in our field people come up with new ideas, and opponents say, \u2018I just don\u2019t believe it.\u2019 [Schweitzer] was having a hard time publishing in journals (Ibid, p. 38).\u201d This type of attitude is in fact very common in the scientific world, and it is well known that every new scientific paradigm has been met with the opposition of experts who insist that the new idea is impossible. It is also well known that some of the greatest new hypotheses and paradigm shifts have been instigated by scholars who, in some way, are outsiders to the scientific establishment \u2013 the most famous example being a patent clerk named Einstein. It is of interest here that Schweitzer, a mother of three and a substitute teacher, came into paleontology in a rather unorthodox manner. Horner recalls that \u201cshe really wasn\u2019t much of a scientist \u2013 which is good ... Scientists all get to thinking alike, and it\u2019s good to bring people in from different disciplines. They ask questions very differently (Ibid, p. 38).\u201d I have been struck by the parallels this story holds with recent developments in paleolinguistics. Maverick linguists have published evidence claiming that taxonomically deep and temporally old language families, encompassing many of the universally accepted language families, can be demonstrated, and even that comparisons of these deep families show that all known human languages share a common origin, and that remnants of specific words of that Proto-Human language can still be found.

In this insightful book, Carl F. Kaestle and his colleagues shed new light on this issue, providing a social history of literacy in America that broadens the definition of literacy and considers who was reading what, under what circumstances, and for what purposes. The book explores diverse sources-from tests of reading ability, government surveys, and polls to nineteenth-century autobiographies and family budget studies-in order to assess trends in Americans' reading abilities and reading habits. It investigates such topics as the relation of literacy to gender, race, ethnicity, and income; the magnitude, causes, and policy implications of the decline in test scores in the early 1970s; the reasons women's magazines have been more successful than magazines for men; and whether print technology has fostered cultural diversity or consolidation. It concludes that there has been an immense expansion of literacy in America over the past century, against which the modest skill declines of the 1970s pale by comparison. There has also been tremendous growth in the availability, purchase, and use of printed materials. In recent decades, however, literacy has leveled and even declined in some areas of reading, as shown in the downward trends in purchases of newspapers and magazines.

Developments in technology have changed the way family photographs are translated within the news with the shift from analogue to digital. This has resulted in the blurring of the boundaries between the public and the private in the press. \n \nDrawing on my personal archive of collected examples of family photographs in newspapers this paper will focus on the temporal qualities of the family photograph in the context of the newspaper.

This is evidenced by the newspaper captions and headlines that often have a temporal dimension, such as 'The last family photograph' dramatically making clear the finality of these images. In a sense these family photographs take on a new and important responsibility of being the last visual record. These 'last' pictures are also different in experienced temporality; they are the last photograph for the family, but the first photograph for the reader i.e. 'the first picture of the last picture.' \n \nOn-line social networking sites like Facebook have allowed the newspapers greater access to family photographs resulting in the use of more candid types of imagery. Developments in technology have also brought about a shift in the viewers expectations of immediacy. Family photographs are taken so close to the time of the reported incident that this 'proximity' of the photograph to the event becomes a signifier of meaning in and of itself. Whether the image is a good family photograph or not is outweighed by the temporal nearness of the incident. The immediacy of the image is conveyed by the headline; 'minutes after this photo was taken'.

Beard"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2011}, "2": {"title": "The Politics of Literacy.", "abstract": "AFTER DECADES OF debate inside the educational community, literacy policy has recently moved to the larger stage of national politics. Prior to 1997 no federal bill had specifically addressed child literacy as an issue. But in the 2000 presidential campaign, George W. Bush regularly touted his record on literacy, and he and his wife Laura, a former librarian, speak of reading as \"the new civil right.\" Legislators debate literacy philosophy and methodology--such as phonics versus whole language--and newspaper headlines track how U.S. kids read in comparison with the rest of the world. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, which federalizes literacy policy in important ways, is hotly debated in state legislatures, Congress, and federal courts. The transformation of literacy from an educational concern to a national political issue has been swift and significant. In a sense, literacy has traveled the same federalization road as educational policy generally, moving from local school boards and statehouses to our nation's capital in less than a decade. Two former governors, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, wrestled with literacy and education at the state level before packing up the problems and bringing them along to the White House. In fact, the road to federalizing literacy policy moves largely through Sacramento, California and Austin, Texas on its way to Washington, D.C. Playing out literacy on the national political stage reframes everything--the issues, the vocabulary, and the cast of characters. Literacy is not merely a problem now; it is a crisis. Improving literacy is not just an educational or social need; it is essential if the United States is to compete in the new global economy. Everyone seems ready to declare war on the enemy--illiteracy--but experts define and measure the problem differently and propose varied methods of attack. In fact, the several combatants in the war on illiteracy seem to expend as much ammunition firing on one another as they do in attacking the problem. The politicians in Washington, the scholars in their ivory towers, the vested interests in our communities, and the teachers and students in the trenches all seem to be warring among themselves at the same time they are trying to combat the common enemy. Much was written about literacy when it played on the academic stage as an educational issue. Now that political attention and governmental dollars are involved, it is time to assess literacy on the public policy stage. What can we learn by tracking the politics of literacy? Will greater political attention and government expenditure improve literacy? Can illiteracy be overcome in the twenty-first century? Literacy policy travels eastward ONE WAY TO TRACK the story of how literacy became a national political issue is to follow its path through two key states on its way to Washington, D.C. The story begins, as new political trends often do, in the Golden State, California. There, an ambitious politician, Superintendent of Education Bill Honig, joined forces with advocates of \"whole language\" instruction to revise the California reading curriculum. Changes in the educational approach of a major state such as California have a corresponding effect on national textbook publishing and on the policies of other states. In the late 1980s, Honig decided to launch a major reform of California education centered on reading. Some say he was simply doing his job as superintendent of education, but most believe Honig had a larger political agenda, including a possible run for governor of California. Under his leadership, the state initiated a program called Reading Recovery that had been developed by a New Zealand teacher, Mary Clay. Honig apparently wanted to recast reading instruction in a \"great books\" format, encouraging the development of reading skills in the context of exposing students to rich literature. Perhaps unwittingly, however, he tied his policies to an educational/political movement called \"whole language. \u2026", "authors": ["David L. Davenport", "Jeffery M.

In this article, I survey the changes underway as journalism becomes less a profession and more a practice, a way of reading and writing about society. I draw from journalism studies and civic literacy pedagogies to argue that the writing classroom has a valuable role to play in shaping civic literacy practices in concert with those of citizen journalism. Many of the practices of citizen journalism\u2014including research, analysis, community engagement, the consideration of evidence and perspectives, a move toward new means of publication and social action\u2014are exactly those capturing the attention of composition scholars. The Paperless End of Newspapers: A Death With some regularity, newspapers carry stories of the death of newspapers. Advertising revenue is down, positions are cut, and established publications such as the Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado, which had printed for 149 years, are shuttered with a farewell and their own obituary as final headlines. Unstoppable technological, economic, and social forces are usually blamed. Many news readers turn to the internet, where readership of newspapers has been growing, although newspapers struggle to learn how to capitalize upon that growth. This is a grim time for traditional newspapers. It is also a time of opportunity and promise for digital literacies and citizen journalism, the potentials of which are the focus of this article. I begin by surveying the present state of journalism and considering the rise of citizen journalism, participatory culture, and news ecosystems\u2014drawing heavily from journalism studies and civic literacy within composition\u2014before proposing a pedagogy in which practices of civic literacy may merge with those of citizen journalism in the writing classroom. Academics and journalism professionals are scrambling to try to come to terms with the technological, economic, and social revolution underway in journalism. They want to know what a post-newspaper newspaper might be, who will read and write and produce it, and what effects those changes might have for our democracy. As this is a growing concern, and as many of those writing about journalism are rather prolific writers themselves, there is much reading to do and much of it in the form of the blog posts that are part of the new journalism. (Jeff Jarvis\u2019s BuzzMachine and Jay Rosen\u2019s PressThink are two examples.) Readings from the field of journalism studies inform a substantial portion of the theory supporting this article. To give but one example of the concern, Princeton University researchers Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and Miguel Garrido found in a recent study that after the closure of the Cincinnati Post voter participation dropped and local elections were less competitive in the precincts that most relied upon the Post for political coverage. They note that their study is statistically imprecise but nonetheless argue that it is a negative portend for democratic life after the closure of a newspaper. \u201cDo newspapers play a valuable, irreplaceable role in American Page 1 of 16 CF 25: \u201cThe Open Gates of the Fourth Estate\u201d by Eric Leake http://compositionforum.com/issue/25/civic-literacy-citizen-journalism.php democracy, or can new media fill the gap when a newspaper closes?\u201d they ask (19). In response to this open and continually debated question, Schulhofer-Wohl and Garrido answer, \u201cIf voter turnout, a broad choice of candidates and accountability for incumbents are important for democracy, we side with those who lament newspapers\u2019 decline\u201d (20). Communications and public policy professor Paul Starr similarly argues that the decline in newspapers means their traditional governmental watchdog function will go unfulfilled, allowing an increase in governmental corruption, especially on the local level. \u201cIf we take seriously the notion of newspapers as a fourth estate or a fourth branch of government, the end of the age of newspapers implies a change in our political system itself,\u201d Starr writes. \u201cNewspapers have helped to control corrupt tendencies in both government and business. If we are to avoid a new era of corruption, we are going to have to summon that power in other ways. Our new technologies do not retire our old responsibilities.\u201d Similarly, Robert McChesney and John Nichols link the health of American democracy to that of journalism, writing, \u201cWe do not know the precise character or content of the news media that will develop; but we do know that without bona fide structures for gathering and disseminating news and analysis, the American experiment in democracy and republican governance will be imperiled\u201d (xi). Here is presented one peek at the future of a newspaperless society. To the extent that a newspaperless future is yet undetermined, there are other possibilities for civic life and literacy in such a society. In the words of Clay Shirky, a professor of new media at NYU, \u201cSociety doesn\u2019t need newspapers. What we need is journalism\u201d (\u201cNewspapers\u201d). Perhaps journalism can fill the space being vacated by newspapers. Writing in Slate, media critic Jack Shafer argues against the implications of the Schulhofer-Wohl and Garrido study (\u201cDemocracy\u2019s Cheat Sheet?\u201d). Newspapers carry a lot of frivolous news, Shafer writes. And when they do publish the type of investigative pieces that newspaper advocates champion, those articles only occasionally have the civic effect that journalists desire. For example, the New Orleans Times-Picayune\u2019s early expose on the weakness of the city\u2019s levees did nothing to avert the failure of those levees. Although, to be fair, there are comparable examples of when newspaper journalism does make a difference. The Pulitzer winners for public service showcase some of the best. Shafer notes that today\u2019s newspaper is a fairly modern invention and that our democracy functioned well enough during our first century without a mainstream press, when the freedoms of the press were primarily enjoyed by the likes of pamphleteers, the early American equivalent to today\u2019s bloggers. \u201cThe insistence on coupling newspapering to democracy irritates me not just because it overstates the quality and urgency of most of the work done by newspapers but because it inflates the capacity of newspapers to make us better citizens, wiser voters, and more enlightened taxpayers,\u201d Shafer writes. \u201cI love news on newsprint, believe me, I do. But I hate seeing newspapers reduced to a compulsory cheat sheet for democracy.\u201d Too frequently absent from this debate is sustained attention to what, if anything, might enter the civic spaces created with the departure of newspapers. What forms will civic literacy take if the citizenry is not dependent upon a mainstream press, a case that Shafer argues never was the case? What type of citizen journalism might rise to fill the space left by a newspaper economy in decline yet not in collapse? This is not a vision of a newspaperless society but of one where civic literacy practices and journalism are redefined, with important implications for the writing classroom. \u201cWe are in the midst of a citizen-driven media revolution, the outcome of which no one can predict,\u201d Leonard Witt writes (55). \u201cBut one thing is fairly certain: public journalism has morphed into the public\u2019s journalism.\u201d Witt, a professor of communications and himself a former journalist, is referring to the certainty that old media models are fading while the public is taking greater control and a greater participatory role in creating and consuming its own journalism. No longer will journalism be written in the public\u2019s interest for a public that only reads the news. In the new citizen journalism, the public is news consumer and also news writer, editor, and publisher. Shirky also mentions revolution Page 2 of 16 CF 25: \u201cThe Open Gates of the Fourth Estate\u201d by Eric Leake http://compositionforum.com/issue/25/civic-literacy-citizen-journalism.php in a recent blog post, relating the digital transformation affecting the newspaper to the social and technological transformation ushered in by Gutenberg: When someone demands to know how we are going to replace newspapers, they are really demanding to be told that we are not living through a revolution. They are demanding to be told that old systems won\u2019t break before new systems are in place. They are demanding to be told that ancient social bargains aren\u2019t in peril, that core institutions will be spared, that new methods of spreading information will improve previous practice rather than upending it. They are demanding to be lied to. (\u201cNewspapers\u201d) Shirky is writing here of the newspaper industry\u2019s attempts to reckon with the transformations affecting them. He finds an industry in denial, one that fails to realize the revolutionary scope of the changes taking place. I am interested in the new systems mentioned by Shirky and referenced by Witt. I am interested in what forms these \u201cnew methods of spreading information\u201d might take and how those forms and methods relate to social practices for civic literacy for and beyond the composition classroom. In the next section, I review the dominant questions concerning civic literacy within rhetoric and composition, with special attention to democratic hopes of the digital revolution. I then explore the idea of citizen journalism through Jenkins\u2019s idea of participatory culture, an idea which is useful in attempting to take stock of the citizen-driven media revolution referenced by Witt and Shirky. Focusing upon redefinitions of journalism and journalism\u2019s relation to the public, I give special attention to the interrelation of the mainstream press and the blogosphere in digitally mediated environments, or what Jarvis describes as news ecosystems.

The dramatic shift in college enrollment demographics\u2014taking men from the majority to the minority on university campuses (71% in 1947 compared to 42.9% in 2009, Snyder & Dillow, 2011)\u2014has certainly made the headlines, but it is the underlying problem of teenage boys and school that is particularly grim. Only 65% of boys graduate from high school as compared with 72% of girls (Greene & Winters, 2006). According to the National Center for Education Statistics (Snyder & Dillow, 2011), for every 10 girls who drop out of school early, 14 boys do. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be suspended from school and three times more likely to be expelled. They are also three times more likely to be diagnosed with a learning disability or ADHD (Visser, Bitsko, Danielson, Perou, & Blumberg, 2010), only half as likely to be on the honor roll (Klienfeld, 2009), and only half as likely to engage in student government or any other form of extracurricular, school-affiliated activity, including sports. Literacy sees the worst of it (Snyder & Dillow, 2011). Boys routinely score lower than girls on basic literacy assessments such as the NAEP test, with one third of male students in 4 th , 8 th , and 12 th grade testing below basic in reading compared to one fifth of female students. The gap widens with age. Boys consistently underperform in\u2014or opt out of\u2014literacy-related courses such as English and composition. By the end of high school, one in four boys with college-educated parents reads below basic level, meaning they cannot read a newspaper with understanding (Klienfeld, 2009). One proposed explanation is the \" displacement hypothesis, \" which assumes that engagement in digital and print media is a zero-sum game such that, if teenage boys were playing videogames less, they would be reading print text more. Such an assumption is evident in reports such as the National Endowment for the Arts' (NEA's) Reading at Risk (Bradshaw & Nichols, 2004), which documented a 10% national decline in literary reading.

Middletown Schools to Be Taken Over by State for Failure to Develop Democratic Citizens If you answered b, you not only answered correctly, your response also reflected an important challenge facing our democracy today. While we say that we value a democratic society, the very institutions expected to prepare democratic citizens -- our schools -- have moved far from this central mission. There is now frequent talk of \"state takeovers\" of schools that fail to raise test scores in math or reading, but it is unimaginable that any school would face such an action because it failed to prepare its graduates for democratic citizenship. The headlines we read are about test scores, basic skills, and the role schools play in preparing students for jobs in the Information Age. The vast bulk of school resources are going to literacy, mathematics, science, and vocational education. In 2003, for example, federal expenditures by the Department of Education on civic education totaled less than half of one percent of the overall department budget.1 And when it comes to assessment, civic goals get very little attention. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act mandates yearly testing in math, reading, and, beginning in 2005, science. Social studies and civic education, the areas of the curriculum most tied to the democratic mission of schools, share no such requirements. Similarly, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which is often referred to as the \"Nation's Report Card,\" measures performance in math and reading annually -- but administers a civics assessment only about once every 10 years. Clearly, math, reading, and science are important, but, from the standpoint of supporting a democratic society, academic subject matter, when disconnected from its social relevance, is insufficient. The same can be said of colleges and universities. Their commitments to democratic priorities are more rhetorical than substantive. We are concerned here with what is not being discussed in the newspapers. We are concerned that the great school debates of our time give short shrift to a fundamental principle that, for more than two centuries, informed efforts to advance the notion of public schooling. This article addresses an important gap in our education agenda: preparing students to be effective democratic citizens. For the past three years, we studied 10 educational programs, funded by the Surdna Foundation, that were unusual in that they put the challenge of educating for democratic citizenship at the center of their efforts.2 We studied 10th-graders evaluating a juvenile detention center, ninth-graders studying the feasibility of curbside recycling, and 11th-graders reporting to the public on the availability of affordable housing in their community. We examined programs that exposed university students to community development projects in Silicon Valley, brought theology majors to a reservation to study the history of Native American experience, and led students interested in social movements on an intensive journey through historical sites of the civil rights movement. We visited an adult education program with a 70-year history of working for social and economic change through education and democratic action. All in all, we interviewed dozens of instructors and students, administered more than 500 surveys, observed pedagogical practices, and examined portfolios of student work. These programs share an emphasis on helping students to identify and act on issues of importance to themselves and to society. \u2026", "authors": ["Joseph Kahne", "Joel Westheimer"], "citations": 217, "venue": "", "year": 2003}, "7": {"title": "Trickster of Literacy", "abstract": "When James Welch died, the matter of his passing was discussed in an inadvertently comic mode in Missoula at the gym where I used to work out in the mornings.

Consider these headlines. * \"Ways of Teaching Reading Debated: It's Phonics vs. 'Whole Language'\" (Anthony Hint, Boston Globe, 7 November 1995); * \"The Reading and Writing Wars\" (22 November 1996, Wall Street Journal); * \"The Great Debate Revisited\" (Art Levine, December 1994, Atlantic); * \"As Reading Scores Plummet, States Get Hooked on Phonics\" (Laurel Walters, 18 April 1996, Christian Science Monitor); * \"Parents Report on America's Reading Crisis: Why the Whole Language Approach to Teaching Has Failed Millions of Children\" (Art Levine, October 1996, Parents Magazine); * \"Phonics Boom: Proponents Say Any Other Approach to Reading Only Spells Trouble\" (Elizabeth Kastor, 15 November 1996, Washington Post); * \"Why Kids Can't Read in California\" (Debra Saunders, 12 January 1996, San Francisco Chronicle); * \"California Leads Revival of Teaching by Phonics\" (22 May 1996, New York Times); * \"State Embraces Phonics in Approving New Texts\" (Richard Colvin, 13 December 1996, Los Angeles Times); and * \"State Rejects 2 Texts, Citing Phonics Law\" (Robert Gunnison, 13 December 1996, San Francisco Chronicle). In essence, what these headlines promise, the accompanying articles deliver. The media and politicians blame whole language for California's (and other states') reading problems. Respected reading researchers are defamed and pitted against one another in the media. \"Quick fix\" solutions are proposed and acted on by state boards and legislatures, and phonics-based curricula, materials, and drills are being implemented in many places - indeed, mandated in some. All this activity seems to be designed to get back to the way reading was taught in the \"good old days.\" Most of the current proposals that enjoy political support consist primarily of throwing out recent decades of cognitive, linguistic, and sociocultural research in favor of embracing the beliefs of the past. Are we educators going to stand for this? Do we want politicians and the media to shape public opinion and then make decisions about reading education based on their own understandings, rather than on those of literacy researchers? If educators allow this to happen in the area of reading and literacy education, it will inevitably spread to science, math, and social studies as well. Why Is This Happening? If I were a political scientist or a policy analyst, I would probably provide a very sophisticated and complex answer to the question of why this is happening now. In fact, I'm sure that the answer is multidimensional and complex. But I'm just a reading researcher and teacher educator, and I view all the sensationalism and politics only from my own perspective. To me, it looks as though the \"war\" between whole language and phonics is little more than an opportunity for politicians to call attention to themselves and to trick the general public into believing that they are leading the way toward crucial and necessary changes in the public schools. School issues are always \"hot\" issues because public schools affect everyone. Whether you are a parent, a grandparent, a great-grandparent, or a prospective parent of a child in public school, you are probably concerned. Even if your children are in private schools or if you do not have children, public school issues affect you. \u2026", "authors": ["R. F.

Sayers, best known for her Lord Peter Wimsey detective novels, spoke at a press conference held at the Berners Hotel, London. Here, she read an excerpt from the fourth installment of her forthcoming radio play-cycle on the story of Christ, The Man Born to Be King. The first play, based on the nativity, was to be broadcast on the BBC the Sunday before Christmas, and this press conference was meant to give the listening public a taste of what was to come. Instead, following a reading of a dialogue where the disciple Matthew speaks in a working-class Cockney accent and uses American slang, a firestorm broke out among the press. The Daily Mail ran the sensational headline \"BBC Life of Christ Play in U.S. Slang\" and the Daily Herald falsely reported \"Gangsterisms in Bible Play\" (Briggs 567). After reading the newspaper accounts of the forthcoming broadcasts, extreme Protestant groups such as the Lord's Day Observance Society (LDOS) and the Protestant Truth Society began protesting Sayers' play-cycle, writing letters to the BBC, the Ministry of Information (MOI), and the Archbishop of Canterbury, and running an advert in The Times with the heading \"Radio Impersonation of Christ!\"2 Due to the public outcry and the desire to avoid any unnecessary religious controversy, the MOI's Brendan Bracken requested that Sayers' radio plays be reviewed by the Central Religious Advisory Committee (CRAC), who, after reading the scripts, overwhelmingly approved the productions. Even those committee members who raised doubts about the broadcasts ruled in favor of Sayers' play-cycle as they neither wanted to set a precedent of appeasing fringe religious organizations like the LDOS, nor offend Britain's main ally and newcomer to the war by suggesting that American English was beneath the dignity of the disciples (Brabazon 204).While this second reason may initially seem irrelevant, given that Sayers' broadcasts were intended for a national audience, this point actually gets at the heart of a larger British self-marketing problem that impacted mass media and cultural productions. As Marina MacKay notes, one of the biggest propaganda battles Britain faced at the outset of the war was a national \"rebranding\" campaign, which, bolstered by MOI propaganda, depicted Britain's struggles as a \"'people's war'\" that relied upon the \"mythology of classless civilian solidarity\" (MacKay 23).3 Standing somewhere between MOI-sanctioned and independent art, Sayers' yearlong (21 December 1941-18 October 1942) radio serial The Man Born to Be King offered the BBC a tremendous opportunity to recast Britain in favorable terms, these being that the nation was historically egalitarian and Christian (much like the U.S.). Promoting such a positive, albeit fictional, image of Britain to its national listeners was an important step in a larger propaganda campaign that aimed to court U.S. support of Britain's war effort and show Americans that they were, in the words of radio broadcaster J.B. Priestley, \"like us\" (13).4Mass media such as radio and film were particularly important for the national and transnational transmission of this rebranding campaign. One of Britain's main intended audiences during the war's early years was the U.S., whose isolationism Britain hoped to bring to an end.5 Priestley, one of wartime Britain's most famous national broadcasters, epitomized this new image. With his West Yorkshire accent, he took to the BBC's North American Service airwaves and described a unified British population fighting a \"total war.\" He depicted a Britain in transition: as the bombs dropped, entrenched class lines were destroyed, making way for a new \"People's\" Britain. As he describes in his opening broadcast on 30 May 1940:At odd times we've heard a sound like the distant banging of doors, which was, of course, the noise of bombs and anti-aircraftguns. \u2026", "authors": ["Melissa Dinsman"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2015}}, "28": {"0": {"title": "Daemons in the pocket: Contract, commodities and witchcraft in Massachusetts Bay", "abstract": "New England in 1692 was a community grappling with the cosmic meaning of capitalism in an age during which the market came to define life in the Atlantic world.

Levack. New York, Oxford University Press, 2013. xiv, 630 pp. $199.50 US (cloth), $63.00 US (paper). In both the scholarly and popular imaginations, European witchcraft once fit into a narrative of darkness and enlightenment. Witchcraft beliefs and the trials of the witch \"craze\" were (or so the story went) the product of the Middle Ages, and much of the blame for the witch hunts could be placed squarely on the Catholic Church. The trials finally came to an end when the backward and superstitious belief in witchcraft succumbed to the rising forces of secularism and modern science. Scholarship on witchcraft has proliferated over the last fifty years, challenging many aspects of this account. Archival research has redrawn the chronology of the witch-hunts, which did not begin in earnest until the Renaissance and peaked in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Scholars have explored the possibility that particular features of the early modern social and political landscape (such as the rise of the nation state) may have encouraged witch-hunting. Others have pointed out that many rationalist philosophers and empirical scientists maintained a belief in witchcraft, and studies of Catholic demonology have been supplemented with careful consideration of popular witchcraft beliefs. A multitude of regional studies has demonstrated that the witch hunts were, in fact, an agglomeration of a great many local, highly distinctive trials. This explosion of research makes the subject of early modern witchcraft ripe for inclusion in the Oxford Handbook series. As editor Brian Levack notes in his introduction, The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America, like other books in the series, has three purposes: to summarize current knowledge in the field, to identify and discuss the most important literature on and approaches to the subject, and to propose new avenues for research. Levack's volume runs to an impressive 630 pages and includes thirty-two essays by both established and up-and-coming researchers. Reflecting the field of witchcraft studies, the Oxford Handbook is thoroughly interdisciplinary. Levack says that he has made \"no effort to enforce uniformity of approach,\" (10) and the authors look at witchcraft through an array of theoretical lenses. While there are inevitable conflicts of interpretation, many contributors agree that no one approach is sufficient to capture the complexities of witchcraft beliefs and the witch hunts. The essays also consider a variety of source material, including (among others) demonological treatises, folklore, pamphlets, and trial records. Furthermore, the Handbook includes essays on the representation of witchcraft in the less-studied genres of literature and the visual arts. Given the importance of visual culture in both shaping and reflecting early modern notions of witchcraft, it is unfortunate that the volume is not illustrated. The Oxford Handbook is divided into three parts: the first focuses on witch beliefs, especially as they developed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The section as a whole challenges the notion that there was any stable or universally shared understanding of the identity or activities of witches. Many essays explore the interaction between popular and learned discourses on witchcraft, resisting historiographical traditions that maintain their separation. Another common theme is the need to reconsider the \"cumulative concept,\" which has served as an important paradigm in witchcraft studies. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the German archivist and historian Joseph Hansen proposed that the early modern concept of witchcraft emerged from a fusion of pre-existing ideas about magic and heresy. According to Hansen, a \"witch\" became someone who not only practiced maleficium (or magic used for harmful ends), but also made a pact with the devil, attended nocturnal Sabbaths, and was capable of flight. \u2026", "authors": ["K.

The blend resulted from ancient myths of the popular culture of \"benevolent figures, [and] magical protectors of the community,\" and was assimilated into the belief that these women were malicious witches, who threatened men, women, animals, and crops.(2) By the thirteenth century, the beginnings of systematized procedures to rid Europe of the malignant witches had begun, emerging first in southern France, the affluent cities of central France, and the Rhineland. Near the end of the twelfth century, Peter des Vaux wrote that \"almost all of the barons [of Provence] had become harborers and defenders of heretics,\" and the first attacks against the Albigensians by the Inquisition began in 1204.(3)Due to a change in perception of the witch, the Church, by the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, turned to direct retaliatory actions against suspected practitioners of witchcraft. These actions arose from fear that the entire foundation of the Church was threatened by new religions, movements, and a conspiracy initiated by the devil, who used witches as local agents.(4)In the Inquisition's path, women were particularly suspect. While not the only subjects of the Inquisitors' actions, women were certainly central to their accusations. Much of the lore concerning female witches derived from woman's allegedly inferior spiritual strength and her predisposition to the sins of pride, lust, and negligence. The predominant focus on women as agents of the devil was the result of the Church's belief that women possessed power because of their carnality. An example of this trend is found in the Malleus Maleficarum, in which the authors, under the direct influence of the Church, used the carnality of women as their central focus in devising a manual whose purpose was to be a working document for the Inquisitors in their prosecution and persecution of witches.In response to \"complaints of two Dominican Inquisitors, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger, that local ecclesiastical authorities in Germany refused to aid them in their pursuit of heretical witchcraft,\" Pope Innocent VIII, in his Bull of December 9, 1484, ignited \"a plan of action against the world-wide conspiracy of the witches and Satan.\"(5) His order fashioned \"European jurisprudence for nearly three centuries, the duty of combating the Devil and saving mankind from his clutches...[and] it served as justification for pitiless persecution.\"(6) The Malleus Maleficarum was written as part of this massive quest in the name of God and the Holy Church.Innocent's Bull of 1484 was not the first such statement against the influence of the occult against the precepts of the Church. As early as 1140, in his Decretum, Gratian warned the bishops against the \"malefice\" created by the devil:Bishops and their officials must labor with all their strength to uproot thoroughly from their parishes the pernicious art of sorcery and malefice invented by the Devil, and if they find a man or woman follower of this wickedness to eject them foully disgraced from their parishes...Those are held captive by the Devil who, leaving their creator, seek the aid of the Devil. And so Holy Church must be cleansed of this pest. It is also not to be omitted that some wicked women, perverted by the Devil, seduced by illusions and phantasms of demons, believe and profess themselves, in the hours of night, to ride upon certain beasts with Diana, the goddess of pagans, and an innumerable multitude of women, and in the silence of the dead of night to traverse great spaces of earth, and to obey her commands as of their mistress, and to be summoned to her service on certain nights.(7)Clearly Gratian is calling for a purging of the pagan rituals and gods/goddesses from the Church. Unmistakable is his direct reference to women, whom he believes are more easily called to the devil's lair. \u2026", "authors": ["Anita G.

Rather it is the witch hunt that has been the focus of most witchcraft studies. In part, this emphasis reflects the sources, which do more to illuminate the views of the learned than the beliefs of the accused. Often, witch beliefs are either taken as the constructs or the projections of the witch hunters, or dismissed as mere \"superstitions\" with little if any historical significance. In his celebrated essay on the European witch-craze, for example, Hugh Trevor-Roper dismissed such beliefs as \"the mental rubbish of peasant credulity and female hysteria.''l The goal of many \"enlightened\" historians in any case has been to demonstrate their absurdity. Yet even scholars who have drawn on both cultural and social anthropology have tended to downplay the richness of the culture out of which popular notions of witchcraft emerged. Keith Thomas' Religion antl The Decline of Magic and Alan Macfarlane's Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart Englantl stress the function of witch and magical beliefs rather than their meaning. Witchcraft, that is, is portrayed as a form of peasant pragmatism. It could be either benevolent or malevolent according to need, but it was not a significant part of the meaning of a cultural system.2 Recently, however, the relative success, even the fashionableness of the study of \"popular\" culture has created a climate in which it has become possible to attempt a history of the beliefs that underlay notions of popular witchcraft and magic. To be sure, the obstacles the historian confronts in such a study are numerous. The sources are notoriously biased; the necessity for an interdisciplinary approach is inescapable; and, finally, the historian confronts the overall burden of significance. It is to Carlo Ginzburg's credit to have made several rich suggestions about ways around these and similar obstacles in his two most recent books. Moreover, both Storia notturrla Ginzburg's ambitious history of the witches' sabbat and Clues, Myths, and the Historical Method a collection of his essays spanning some thirty years are not only linked together by several common themes and problems of method, they also constitute his most challenging texts yet.3 Thus, this is an ideal occasion to offer an assessment, necessarily preliminary and tentative, of Ginzburg's own assumptions and methods.

It asserted that \"today's youth considers himself practically nude if he is sent out into the streets in anything less than a pair of floppy sheepskins strapped over his roll-bottomed denims, a colored bandanna knotted loosely about the throat of his piped sateen or gabardine shirt, and a wide-brimmed hat settled dashingly about his ears.\" Yet the craze went beyond the desire for clothing items related to the Old West. The commentary also declared that \"no 8-year old believes himself capable of crossing an apartment-house sidewalk without the aid of spurs, and he would think it risky to leave his porch without a pair of matched horse pistols slung from a tooled-leather cartridge belt studded with brilliants\" (Sharnik 16). The cowboy and his gun reigned supreme in the imaginations and play of American children in the early postwar era. In fact, for many adults, the cowboy and other frontier figures served as comforting reminders of a mythic American past in an era fraught with uncertainties. The notion of the cowboy as a quintessential American hero was not new to the postwar era. Since the days of the nineteenth century the appropriation and romanticization of the cowboy in various media forms had catapulted the figure to iconic status. The cowboy now rode across the Cold War landscape as the embodiment of manliness, democracy, individualism, and capitalism. Popular culture promoted the mythological version of the cowboy and the frontier that stood in stark contrast to the anxiety-ridden culture of the Cold War, which drew on, found support in, and perpetuated the myth of the Old West. More importantly, the culture of the Cold War helped to create a new meaning for the toy guns wielded by youngsters engaging in western play. Specifically, it invested the form of amusement with special meaning while simultaneously affecting parenting styles. Parents' attitudes toward their pistol-packin' boys reveal the various layers of their own anxieties concerning the masculinity of their sons. The discourse about toy guns occurring in popular sources readily available to the general American public also exposes the uneasiness pervading the American popular consciousness regarding gender roles, and it sheds light on the roots of America's gun cultures. Ultimately, the anxious climate of the Cold War, punctuated by the threat of instantaneous nuclear annihilation, challenges to traditional gender roles, and the standoff between communism and democracy created an environment in which a youth gun culture could flourish among white male youths. In the early atomic age, children's play had an important role in reclaiming American values in the face of the communist menace. Forms of play drew comments from numerous professionals. From the Parent and Child section of the New York Times Magazine, Dorothy Barclay wrote that \"play means a great deal more ... to most of the specialists who work with children. To them it represents the child's way of learning, a vital process by which he grows up.\" In play, she noted, \"Youngsters experiment with life and their own reactions to it; relieve some of their fears and tensions; re-create the world as they know it or shape a new and happier one where they can be the head men, where they can boss or be babied, threatened or comforted.\" Children's amusements are significant, Barclay argued, because they are a learning process that facilitates development of social skills. If play is fundamental to development, then objects used in play are of primary importance. Therefore, \"parents can start thinking of toys not as bright ornaments for a youngster's room but as materials for . . . expression\" (Barclay 59). Moreover, play provides the means through which children interpret the world, as well as the method they employ to reflect their experiences. If imitation guns are acceptable toys and violent play is sanctioned, then children might very well come to understand that violence is acceptable and even a mundane part of everyday existence in America. \u2026", "authors": ["A.

As a favorite American fairy tale, a cultural narrative, and an expression of national values and identity, The Wizard of Oz exercises a powerful hold on the American imagination. Alissa Burger's critical study, The Wizard of Oz as American Myth, demonstrates that this century-old story is not only vibrantly alive, but still vigorously evolving. Acknowledging this evolution as a story worth unfolding on its own, Burger ambitiously examines six particular incarnations of the classic tale: L. Frank Baum's novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900); the MGM film, The Wizard of Oz (1939); Sidney Lumet's musical, The Wiz (1978); Gregory Maguire's bestselling novel, Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (1995); Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman's hit Broadway show, Wicked (2003); and, lastly, the SyFy Channel's steampunk-styled mini-series, Tin Man (2007). Surveying these lively works, Burger finds that ensuing versions renew, reinterpret, revise, and reinvent their earlier counterparts, and each successive Oz reflects new values indicative of a shifting national identity. Furthermore, each singular Wizard of Oz records important historical, cultural, and ideological shifts, and each, in varying ways, complicates and challenges Baum and Fleming's patriarchal, canonical master narratives. The Wizard of Oz as American Myth may captivate fans, but its critical content will principally appeal to scholars researching the fields of American literature and culture, popular culture, or the fairy tale. Burger splits her explorations into theory and theme. The book begins theoretically, as the focus of Chapter One, \"Reinventing American Myth,\" examines the discourse of American myth and symbol, and Chapter Two, \"Text and Performance,\" introduces theory and analysis regarding performative media--necessary groundwork, for this study encompasses novel, film, drama, and even television mini-series. The second section, composed of the final four chapters, centers on significant themes: Chapter Three, \"Wicked and Wonderful Women,\" conducts a feminist study of the tale's various manifestations. Chapter Four, \"Race, History, and Representation,\" considers ideas of race and the Other. Chapter Five, \"Home Sweet Home,\" sifts through shifting notions of home in these varying narratives, and Chapter Six, \"Magic and Witchcraft,\" reveals revisions in characterizations of the witch and changes in magical agency. Chapter One, \"Reinventing American Myth,\" establishes the historical origins and mythic dimensions of the Wizard of Oz tales as a central, iconic American cultural narrative--part of a revisionist process in which older, dated cultural versions are challenged, updated, and replaced. Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, written at the advent of the twentieth century, offered a new frontier to a country that had all but exhausted its own. Its patriarchal sensibilities urged viewers toward hard work, friendship, and self-sacrifice, messages largely unchallenged by the famed 1939 MGM film, whose Dorothy upholds such virtues, then sacrifices all for Kansan domesticity. Later heroines, however, display the independence to choose freely and blaze untrodden trails. Dorothy in The Wiz returns home only to relocate shortly afterward. Dissatisfied with Kansas, D. G. of Tin Man stays in the O.Z., where this former waitress is a princess. Burger reveals that The Wizard of Oz sequence creates \"new spaces for a multiplicity of positions of femininity, Otherness, and identity\" (25). Later films and tales challenge traditional centers of power and privilege. While Baum's fraudulent, \"fallible but forgivable wizard\" retains his authority (28), and in the MGM film, Oz remains a quasi-utopia over the rainbow where dreams can at least somewhat come true, in Wicked, Oz means an oppressive regime. \u2026", "authors": ["Matthaeus Schumacher"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2014}, "6": {"title": "Chaos Reigns - Women as Witches in Contemporary Film and the Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm", "abstract": "1 An obscure hut in sinister woods, secluded from the outside world, inhabited by an old and wicked, often deformed woman. The image of the witch is etched on the memory from childhood on, characterised by her portrayal in fairy tales and shaped by popular culture, especially contemporary film. Although of pre-Christian origin, and exploited during the peak of the witch-hunts from the late 15th to the middle of the 18th century, the belief in witches has barely forfeited its sometimes dubious popularity. While the commercialisation of other magical and monstrous creatures such as vampires, elves and werewolves follows the trend of Hollywood marketing experts and the development of youth culture, the witch appears to be a constant fictive companion in bed-, children's and living rooms. Be it as animalistic grandmother-gone-bad in the Grimm's Hansel and Gretel or as narcissistic queen in the form of Charlize Theron in Snow White and the Huntsman, the depiction of female witches [1] is versatile, as can be seen by comparing diverse cinematic witch characters with their literary ancestors by the Brothers Grimm.2 Like every legendary figure, real or imagined, the witch is attributed a certain set of characteristics which distinguishes her from others and makes her identifiable. First of all, it is curious that while there is no consistent definition of witchcraft(Kiekhefer 7), many resources are able to draw a clear picture of it. Jacob Grimm in his work about German mythologies for example described witches as old women, who have become unable to love and work (cf. Grimm 599). He considered women in general to be predestined for clandestine magic because they, as opposed to the hard working and war conducting men, have enough time to dedicate themselves to the preparation of healing ointments and from there on it is only a small step to the practice of witchcraft(cf. 599). Their high powers of imagination make them receptive for superstition of any kind. Further it was believed that witches are women who had been seduced by the devil [2] and \"achieve their malevolent, destructive effects only with the aid of Satan and demons\" (Easlea 7). The use of \"malevolent\" here clearly shows a value judgement. The witch's magic is equated with black magic that is used to harm others, for example by bringing them illness, turning them into animals or objects or influencing their love lives. This is opposed to the so-called white magic, which for example was believed to restore health with herbal medicine among others. The witch's magic however is a \"tapping into the forces of nature\" (Berger 19) which changes its order, as often believed to the worse.3 The witch's outer appearance may not be further described by sources, but her supposed behaviour and disposition all the more. From a sociological perspective, the witch was the opposite of the woman's image as propagandized by the church, \"the repentant woman who spent her life cloistered or serving men in order to do penance for her original sin\" (van Vuuren 72). She was used to point out difference (Sempruch 2), namely between the good, virtuous woman and the foul one. Especially sexuality plays a crucial role here, because witches were believed to fornicate with the devil and precipitate the demoralization of society. While the ordinary woman was chaste, the witch was characterized as knowing no sexual boundaries and seducing helpless men whenever she got the chance to do so. But it was not only men who were threatened by witches. It was common belief that witches engage in infanticide and cannibalism (cf. Levack 20), which not only changed but also perverted the idea of the woman as nurturing mother. The witch-hunts hence functioned as a necessary means to secure society's \"moral boundaries\" (Ben-Yehuda 14). In times reigned by poor survival conditions, witches became scapegoats that were held responsible for moral decline and epidemics and led to the so-called witch craze.4 A popular instrument which played an important part in the witch-hunts, and also focussed heavily on women's sexuality, was the so-called Malleus Maleficarum, the \"Hammer of the Witches\", a tract composed in 1486 by Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger, which was supposed to serve as evidence for witchcraftand the evilness of women. \u2026", "authors": ["Annette Schimmelpfennig"], "citations": 2, "venue": "", "year": 2013}, "7": {"title": "Catholic Germany from the Reformation to the Enlightenment .

The Inquisition had no authority in Catholic Germany, and the papacy\u2019s influence was limited. Nevertheless, Roman officials, working with bishops and nuncios, tried to stop or limit witch crazes. An outbreak of demonic possession in the Bishopric of Paderborn in the 1650s came to the attention of Pope Alexander VII, who was reported \u201cto wonder not a little at the simplicity of the superstitious, on the one hand, and at the malice and deceit of others, but finally also at the ignorance of those who had written these records\u201d (p. 168). Papal officials denounced exorcisms conducted by a Jesuit father in Paderborn and argued that the denunciations of the possessed should not be used as evidence against witches in court. Yet Roman influence was limited and local trials led to the execution of dozens of innocent people in this region in the 1650s. Decker convincingly argues that over the course of the sixteenth century leaders of the Catholic Church came to reject the fully developed view of witchcraft so forcefully presented in the Malleus. As a result, few witches were executed in southern Europe, where the jurisdiction of the Roman and Spanish Inquisitions held sway. In northern Europe, particularly in Germany and Scotland, secular courts, succumbing to pressure from the common people, the lower clergy, and local elites, executed witches in large numbers. As Decker insists, \u201cone should not speak of the witch hunts as a policy of \u2018the\u2019 Catholic Church\u201d (p. 215).

Garry Wills. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1997. 380 pp. $26.00 John Wayne's America is a star persona study, one joining a growing scholarly effort to examine the ways in which certain film stars participate in the spread or alteration of ideological values in a culture. Star studies were once essentially popular biographies, some more serious than others, of a star's personal life and career as an actor. They satisfied film viewers' curiosity about the presumed personality behind the image, though too often they served simply to promote a star's image. But in 1979, when Richard Dyer, a British film scholar, published Stars (New Edition, 1998), star personae studies transformed to serious studies of ideology in gender and culture. Through his critical lens, stars became products with particular signification, texts composed of signs that carried particular ideological meanings. Dyer followed with Heavenly Bodies: Film Stars and Society (1986) in which he explained the meaning and importance of Marilyn Monroe, Paul Robeson, and Judy Garland. This semiotic, cultural approach to film stars has led to further refinement by other scholars such as Jackie Stacey, Andrew Britton, or Christine Gledhill. And a few scholarly books on stars such as Clint Eastwood (\"a cultural production\"), Mae West (as \"a cultural icon\"), Cary Grant (\"comedy and male desire\"), and Woody Allen (\"New Yorker\") have appeared. Joining these pioneers of scholarly works to explain what a particular star does is Garry Wills' investigation, which features the mythic, political values of John Wayne in his diverse portrayals of American masculinities. Wills, the author of nineteen previous books, here applies his political and historical acumen to Wayne's mythic film persona as an icon with gendered cultural implications. The book establishes that Wayne and the image manufacturers ignored and distorted Wayne's real life in order to create his mythic male persona. Further, Wills shows that Wayne, through his film roles, filled the needs of his vast American audiences in crucial periods of America's recent history. He became the embodiment of their deepest myths. Wayne, both particularly and exceptionally, validated and repulsed values that came to mean what millions of Americans regard as \"being American.\" But he also invented a mythic man. As Wills explains at one point, \"his body spoke a highly specific language of `manliness,' of self-reliant authority. It was a body impervious to outside force, expressing a mind narrow but focused, fixed on the task, impatient with complexity. This is a dangerous ideal to foster. It is 'male' in a way that has rightly become suspect-one sided, exclusive of values conventionally labeled 'female'.\" He became the \"figment of other people's imaginations,\" a \"hollow triumph,\" as Wills judges Wayne. He takes his readers on a tour of Wayne's varied male roles. As he puts it, \"Wayne was not just one type of Western hero. He is an innocently leering ladies' man in his B films of the thirties, a naif in Stagecoach, an obsessed adolescent in Shepherd of the Hills, a frightened cattle capitalist in Red River, a crazed racist in The Searchers, a dutiful officer in cavalry pictures, the worldly-wise elder counselor in later movies. He is sometimes a hothead, more often the restrainer of hotheads.\" So while Wayne was not one type of male, his main project, as Wills argues throughout the book, was to \"build a persona full of portent.\" And he kept it out of danger, refusing to play a coward and never playing himself, for he was, above all, as a real man, very flawed and a very different man than the one he created. \u2026", "authors": ["G.

Within the patchwork of small territories, Catholic and Protestant, that was southern Germany were areas that saw few witch-trials and others that saw many, periods that were relatively quiet and waves of mass persecutions. Roper incorporates the stress on local circumstances that has characterized modern witchcraft studies, analyzing particular family and neighborhood jealousies, suspicions, and hostilities that gave rise to witch accusations in great detail. In these situations, particularly when accusations grew into mass panics, learned and popular understandings of witchcraft intertwined; some things, such as sex with the devil, moved from the world of learned demonology into local accusations, while others, such as witches entering cellars and storerooms to steal food and wine, moved from popular charges into demonology. This intertwining is hardly surprising, for many of the writers of demonological treatises, including Heinrich Kramer, the author of the Malleus Maleficarum, had been witch-hunters first; their writings grew out of their experience in the field, not scholarly contemplation. The most vigorous witch-hunters were the Catholic prince-bishops who were both secular and religious powers in their territories; as Roper notes, nine of these men were responsible for over 6,000 deaths. Witch-hunting is often contrasted with the other activities of these same men \u2014 founding universities and hospitals, building spectacular baroque churches, modernizing their administrative bureaucracies \u2014 but Roper makes clear that witch-hunting was an outgrowth of, and not a contradiction to, their vision of the perfect Christian state. Such states existed in a post-Reformation world of religious conflict and confessionalization, a political and social context that Roper integrates effectively. That context did not cause the witch-hunts, however, and Roper never allows us to forget how the power of imagination and individual will worked together in this deadly part of baroque culture, just as they did in art and literature.

Enter the Age of \u2018Fake News\u2019 The practice of strategically disseminating and publishing false information has a long history in politics, international relations, and warfare, and can have extremely negative consequences for individuals and for society.1 This has been especially true during the global COVID-19 pandemic, with not only politicians and pundits creating and spreading \u2018fake news\u2019, but also journalists and other trusted information sources.2 Furthermore, \u2018fake news\u2019 on COVID-19 is also spreading like wildfire through invitation-only discussion forums on social media platforms,3 with potentially more dangerous consequences. While broadcast media are subject to some degree of public scrutiny, falsehoods spread through private and relatively closed networks can be magnified further, and given 1 Leonie Haiden, \u2018Tell Me Lies, Tell Me Sweet Little Lies\u2019, in Jente Althuis and Leonie Haiden (eds.)

The rise of \u2018fake news\u2019 has brought these practices to the forefront not only of academic, business, and political discourses, but also of public, social media, and mass media debates.5 Although \u2018fake news\u2019 is loosely defined in the academic literature as \u2018false news intended to mislead audiences\u2019, the 2016 US presidential election shifted the usage of the term, that is, to call any statement \u2018fake news\u2019 now also serves to dismiss information one disagrees with for the purpose of closing down debate.6 Therefore, the modern practice of \u2018fake news\u2019 can be both strategically useful to, and also an impediment to, persuasive communications. This paper explores academic literature on \u2018fake news\u2019 to derive insights for future strategic communications research and practice. Undoubtedly, early humans strategically communicated inaccurate and untruthful information to each other by signs or spoken words. The term \u2018fake news\u2019 or \u2018false news\u2019 as it was called in the past has identifiable origins in the seventeenth century, as individual actors in the English Civil War exploited the press to disseminate their preferred political viewpoints and to shape public opinion.7 In the early twentieth century, the silent movie era icon Stan Laurel\u2019s catastrophic marriages and heavy drinking attracted vast media attention, although much of what was reported was untrue. His biographer John Connolly notes, \u2018He [Laurel] wonders how many acres of newsprint have been filled by words he has not said, forming an entire alternative history of his life in which nothing has meaning or substance unless it forms the punch line to a gag\u2019.8 Print media and radio accelerated the spread of false news in the first half of the twentieth century, and television expanded the trend in the latter half. However, it was the advent of the internet as we know it today, in the mid-1990s, and the emergence of social media in the early twenty-first century that have really put the generation and dissemination of \u2018fake news\u2019 into overdrive.9 4 Kelly R.

Strategic communications researchers and practitioners need to further understand how the conversation surrounding \u2018fake news\u2019 is evolving, and how its practice is changing, not only in the mass media but in other strategic domains such as digital communication channels. 11 As the academic literature on \u2018fake news\u2019 is scattered among many different fields, a comprehensive mapping of this literature is needed to establish what has been written and what further questions are still to be investigated. As Jane Webster and Richard T. Watson posit, new theoretical and conceptual contributions need to be based on reviews and syntheses of extant thought in the literature, both for mature topics and also for emerging issues.12 This paper provides a review and synthesis of the \u2018fake news\u2019 literature to develop concise insights for future strategic communications research and practice. Specifically, we seek answers to the following questions: \u2022 How has the amount of research on \u2018fake news\u2019 evolved over time? \u2022 What are the key terms associated with \u2018fake news\u2019 in the literature? \u2022 Who are the most prominent researchers and what links do they have to each other? \u2022 Which journals and universities are the most prolific and influential in their publication of \u2018fake news\u2019 research? 10 Hunt Allcott and Matthew Gentzkow, \u2018Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election\u2019, Journal of Economic Perspectives 31, N\u00b0 2 (2017): 211\u201336. 11 David MJ.

New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2001. \"The world is movie mad,\" wrote one early silent-picture star in the San Francisco Examiner in 1915. And indeed, in her fine study of the rise of Hollywood celebrity culture, Samantha Barbas describes how America would become even more movie crazy as the twentieth century progressed. Using an impressive variety of source material, including archival fan clippings from the collections of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and private fan scrapbooks, Barbas gives us a clear, thoughtful portrait of the American movie fan. She explores the complicated relationships among movie fans, film celebrities, and the film industry of Hollywood from the earliest days of silent films through the late 1940s. Barbas challenges the caricature of American movie fans as the \"frenzied mob and the silly schoolgirl\" stereotypes that have been portrayed, ironically enough, in Hollywood films through the years. Movie fans, she argues, have contributed to popular film culture in profoundly significant ways since the days of the Nickelodeon. \"The story of film fandom,\" Barbas writes, \"is the story of the way that fans refused to accept mass culture passively and, instead, became actively involved in their entertainment.\" Film fans have never been controlled by an unseen, all-knowing Hollywood dream factory. On the contrary, film fans have done much more than consume movie culture by trying to \"understand, control, and participate in the movies.\" Barbas identifies fandom aptly as \"a quest for authenticity, influence, and involvement\" in American film culture. Fans, never simple or inactive, have represented a shaping force-economically, morally, and aesthetically-on the culture of Hollywood movies. Barbas's characterization of movie fans as active players in the film industry is compelling and convincing. She begins with a discussion of the interests of early moviegoers in the chapter \"Reel to Real.\" In 1911, the editors of the earliest movie fan magazine, Motion Picture Story Magazine, began modifying the magazine's content-originally, short novelized versions of movie plots-in direct response to movie fans' requests for information about their favorite actors. Until they received volumes of mail from fans, the magazine editors \"did not realize . . . that fans were far more interested in stars than in stories.\" Within a year, both Motion Picture Story and its rival publication Photoplay included photo layouts and stories about actors. By 1920, fan magazines were devoted almost exclusively to the private lives of movie actors, now celebrities, with the cooperation of publicity departments in the film studios. Editors and the movie community \"sensed that fans were far more interested in the personal than the professional,\" and they were quick to adapt to the needs of paying fans. Barbas explores other facets of movie fandom with equally convincing documentation and clarity in subsequent chapters. \u2026", "authors": ["P.

Mei Lanfang and the Twentieth-Century International Stage: Chinese Theatre Placed and Displaced. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2012. Pp. xi + 298. +12 illus. $95.00. Mei Lanfang (1894-1961) is indisputably China's greatest jingu (Peking Opera) actor. His prolific fifty-year stage career and personal life have been well documented in autobiography, biographies, personal and professional correspondence, diaries, news clippings, and manuscripts, along with audio and video recordings. His life has been adapted on screen and stage. His former residence is now a memorial museum with extensive archives in photographs, calligraphy, collections, and playbills. Interestingly, he lived through both the old and the new China, transitioned from the relic of the Qing dynasty to the innovation of the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China, and survived the Boxer Rebellion, the Long March, and the Great Leap Forward. Mei is a cultural icon who has undergone significant cultural, political, social, and aesthetic changes in his times, while maintaining his supreme artistry as a female impersonator in Peking Opera. Mei's unrivaled fame and influence also can be attributed to the favorable geographical and social conditions of his era as well as the support from the political, literary, and artistic circles that made him into the rock star of his day. Nevertheless, Min Tian attests in Mei Lanfang and the Twentieth-Century International Stage that \"Mei's art is subject to the placement and displacement of the perceived other which led to the various contests and constructions and reconstructions of theatrical forces\" (222). Specifically, Mei's international tours from 1919 to 1935 helped achieve international acclaim, cemented transnational relationships, and elevated the status of Peking Opera as Chinas national cultural heritage. A study in only five chapters, the first three essays focus on the \"placement\" of Mei Lanfang on the international stage with detailed descriptions of his tours to Japan, America, and the Soviet Union. In each of these three chapters, Tian lays out the historical background of how the Chinese prepared and managed the tours. He then juxtaposes them with the international reception and perception of Mei's performances. Tian's greatest strength is his ability to draw our attention to a balanced history with his comprehensive summary of conflicting views of Mei's tours. Chapter 1 offers possibly the most valuable insight, as it might well be the first in-depth examination of Mei's 1919 and 1924 visits to Japan written in English. Tian contests that the classical versus modern theater struggles in Japan contributed to Mei's success, and that Mei's visit indirectly helped Japan reposition its reform of classical theater. Specifically, Tian believes that Mei's art as nandan helped legitimize the continued standing of onnagata on the kabuki stage. In chapter 2, Tian argues that the success of Mei's 1930 tour to the United States was attributed mostly to the \"opportune conditions of the contemporary American theatre\" (such as Robert Edmond Jones's and Norman Bel Geddes' new stagecraft designs and Eugene O'Neil's expressionistic playwriting) (216). As the title suggests, chapter 3 presents the \"The Chinese Debate on Mei's Soviet Visit\" centering on how the ideological content of traditional Chinese theater is placed in relation to Soviet socialism. Tian asserts that the Soviet establishment was interested in using Mei's visit to strengthen Soviet-Sino political and cultural ties, and to provide its theater practitioners an opportunity to appropriate Chinese theater for its investigation (121). \u2026", "authors": ["Cecilia J.

The release in autumn 2002 of two reports on options for reforming Canada's healthcare system attracted widespread media attention. We explored the potential for each of the four media effects by examining Canadian newspaper representation of this healthcare policy debate. Clippings were gathered from regional and national newspapers. Two data collection methodologies were employed: the first involved two staggered \"constructed weeks\" designed to capture thematic news framing styles; the second collected \"intensive\" or episodic coverage immediately following the report releases. Health reform articles with a financing and/or delivery focus were included. Using a codebook, articles were coded to track article characteristics, tone, healthcare sector and reform themes, and key actors. A greater quantity of episodic (n=341 clippings) versus thematic coverage (n=77) was documented. Coverage type did not vary significantly by newspaper, reporting source (e.g., staff reporter versus staff editorialist) or article type (e.g., news versus letter). Thematic articles were significantly shorter in length compared to episodic clippings. Episodic coverage tended to have a positive tone, while thematic coverage ranged in tone. Most coverage was general in scope. Sector-specific coverage favoured physician and hospital care--the two providers accorded privileged financing arrangements under Canada's universal, provincially administered health-insurance plans. Coverage of healthcare financing arrangements favoured broad discussions of publicly financed healthcare, federal-provincial governmental relations, and the Canada Health Act that governs provincial plans. Governmental actors and the political institutions that they represent were the dominant actors. Professional associations were also visible, but played a less dominant role. Given its non-specific scope, it is unclear how informative this coverage was. The large quantity and short duration of the episodic coverage, and the preponderance of governmental actors, suggests these newspapers acted as conduits for the policy agenda. Differences in framing styles were observed by coverage type, newspaper, reporting source, article length and type of article.

Moreover, the research also talked with 73 respondents comprising of 32 shoppers from Uchumi, 32 shoppers from competing supermarket brands located close to Uchumi\u2019s eight supermarket stores in Nairobi and nine key informants was used. In addition, newspaper clippings and TV clips were analysed to confirm the effect issue news had on shoppers\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 behaviour and choices towards Uchumi. Most of those interviewed, as evidence in this study shows, consider brand equity and reputation as critical to the choices they make. Unfortunately, most of those interviewed, or 95 per cent, considered Uchumi\u2019s reputation and brand as bad largely because of the negative press and challenges it faces. Given this situation, the study notes that Uchumi has been unable to effectively deal with the crisis bedevilling it.

Yet from a contemporary standpoint, the historical narratives prompted in the licensing of her name and image flatten her past into a palatable emblem of 1950s pin-up culture. In this article, I interrogate the ways Page\u2019s image has been mobilized since the 1950s. I propose a cultural biography of Bettie Page attuned to her queer communitarian circulation in order to counter the nostalgic sanitation of her image since the 1990s. In November of 2017, several media industry and gay press news outlets announced that Violet Chachki, drag performer and 2015 RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race season seven champion, would front an advertising campaign for a Bettie Page-inspired lingerie line by London-based brand Playful Promises. [1] [#N1] The campaign featured photography by Anna Swiczeniuk, in which Chachki\u2019s poses, makeup, hairstyle, and apparel evoked a contemporary nostalgic view of Bettie Page\u2019s pin-up style. While the campaign was largely applauded, there was a degree of negative criticism in the form of cis chauvinist comments that usually misgendered Chachki, who self-identifies as genderqueer, and asserted that lingerie should be exclusively worn by cis women. [2] [#N2] Playful Promises publicly denounced the negative commentary and posted a five-prong defense of their marketing decision on Twitter. In sum, this statement denounced the transphobic comments, criticized the gender disparities in pin-up fan communities, and suggested the productive use of drag for marketing a product culturally associated with hyperfemininity. [3] [#N3] In a final polemic statement, the brand positioned the campaign and their decision to foreground \u201ca non-binary model who is not a cis woman, shot by a woman, wearing lingerie created by women\u201d as an all-out industrial assault on the male gaze. [4] [#N4] The company\u2019s redress assigned a political value to their circulation of the Page brand through a queer figure and by extension framed the consumption of their Page-inspired merchandise as equivalent to a political act. Since the resurgence of interest in Bettie Page in the 1990s, decontextualized nostalgia and generalizable alterity have become two primary facets of Page\u2019s star image that maintain her popularity across a variety of subcultures. Contemporary cultural trends position Bettie Page as an offbeat alternative to the nostalgic appreciation of 1950s pin-up culture.

Yet the actual history of Page\u2019s past queer circulation and its regulation is all but forgotten in her contemporary mainstream commodification. The commodification of queer culture has a vast history: in the 1930s Queen Christina (1933) tie-in apparel traded on the distinctively gay camp sensibility that inspired Garbo\u2019s wardrobe, [5] [#N5] during the brief surge of \u201cbisexual chic\u201d in the 1970s David Bowie\u2019s public self-identification as both gay and bisexual functioned to market his Ziggy Stardust album, and more recently, neoliberal capitalization on diversity abounds. As seen in the Chachki example, Page\u2019s property retains a relationship with queerness and sex-positivity, but that relation necessarily privileges self-expression over communitarian solidarity. A critical cultural biography of Bettie Page would be cognizant of the proliferation of access to her persona that defined the queer circulation of her likeness in the 1980s and preceded the aggressive regulation of her image as a media property. This article aims to examine the circulation and merchandising of Bettie Page over the span of several decades. In doing so, it offers a bridge between material culture studies and star studies via an industrial micro-history of the pin-up photograph, a publicity photo repurposed as film merchandise. A broad temporal frame allows a historical and comparative lens for critically engaging with merchandising\u2019s tendency to occlude both histories of struggle and the ideological underpinnings of licensing practices. [6] [#N6] In this article I recount and juxtapose the trajectories that Bettie Page\u2019s image has taken in three cultural moments from the 1950s to the 1990s. Movie Stars without Movies: Irving Klaw, Bettie Page, and the Mid-century Pin-up Industry During the World War II era, the merchandising of Hollywood film culture created pin-up culture and by extension produced the public persona of Bettie Page. [7] [#N7] This seemingly simplistic observation has been largely understated in both academic and popular historiography of the midcentury pin-up industry. It is also significant because it underscores the formative contradiction of much of pin-up culture: there are \u201cmovie stars\u201d without movies. Bettie Page was, for all intents and purposes, a \u201cmovie star\u201d at least a decade before she appeared in a feature length motion picture because there was a shared functional origin and resulting cultural slippage between the categories of \u201cmovie star\u201d and \u201cpin-up.\u201d This slippage resulted dually from the proliferation of non-movie star pin-ups that substituted for a decrease in Hollywood pin-ups, and from the career transitions of successful pin-up models, such as Marilyn Monroe, into movie stars. [8] [#N8] This observation is important to both star studies and studies of material culture since the pin-up was a publicity still refashioned, and eventually monetized, for fan consumption. The publicity photo was one of a variety of marketing techniques for singling out screen talent that, as star studies examining cinema\u2019s transitional-era have shown, facilitated the shift from a discourse on acting to an appreciation of individual stars. [9] [#N9] From a material history perspective, industrial conditions sparked changes in the production and consumption of pin-ups by the 1940s as they became viable forms of film merchandise. The mid-century pin-up industry began as the still photo merchandising of stars. The commercialization of non-movie star pin-ups followed a wartime product shortage of \u201cactual\u201d movie star photographs. This product shortage was due to wartime cutbacks generally, studios underestimating the still\u2019s profit potential, and conservative public relations practices 11/26/18, 10)56 AM From AIDS-era Queer Icon to Sanitized Nostalgic Property: The Cultural Histories of Bettie Page Merchandise Circulation Page 3 of 18 https://preview.quod.lib.umich.edu/f/fc/13761232.0042.203/--from-aids-era-queer-icon-to-sanitized-nostalgic-property?rgn=main;view=fulltext that considered pin-ups too crass a form of commercial exploitation. [10] [#N10] The reduction in movie star stills effectively created the market for non-movie star pin-ups. In our contemporary cultural landscape, the name Irving Klaw has little resonance other than bifurcated associations that, on initial consideration, do not match up. For fans of pin-up culture, and Bettie Page fans specifically, Irving Klaw more or less means: the auteur behind Bettie Page\u2019s \u201cdark side,\u201d namely the bondage photos and loops featuring Page. For fans of Hollywood film culture, and for film studies scholars who worked during the 1970s and 1980s, Irving Klaw was known as the founder and collector of a vast for-profit archive of Hollywood promotional materials, particularly film stills, known as Movie Star News. A history of Irving Klaw\u2019s commercial operations links these two disparate associations, and reveals Klaw as a missing link between the mainstream Hollywood film industry and the seemingly marginal print and motion picture industries that commercially exploited sex. Movie Star News emerged out of the merchandising of Hollywood stardom in the late 1930s. In 1936, Irving Klaw opened a secondhand bookstore in Manhattan called Irving Klaw\u2019s Bookshop. [11] [#N11] Specializing in magazine back issues, the store advertised in the classifieds sections of local newspapers. [12] [#N12] Klaw\u2019s idea to sell individual photographs of movie stars came to him when he noticed youths, young women as the myth goes, attempting to cut clippings of movie star pictorials from his magazines. [13] [#N13] The store soon shifted to focus on movie merchandising, primarily specializing in still photographs, but also stocking other forms of Hollywood memorabilia. Klaw\u2019s innovation was in realizing that the promotional still photograph could serve both as advertising for the attractions and commodities offered by the movie industry, and as a form of merchandise that promoted itself as a material means for fans to demonstrate their devotion to a star. His operation soon made waves in the motion picture industry as he forged business ties with studios in order to acquire product, and he quickly became known as a crucial intermediary between the studios and picturegoers. By the early 1940s, Hollywood studios and industry reporters considered Klaw a definitive gauge of audience interests. In 1943, Variety devoted a front-page article to Klaw\u2019s operation, calling it \u201cthe largest mail order film still biz in the country.\u201d [14] [#N14] Harry Rauch of the Los Angeles Times bestowed an even loftier international status on Klaw as the \u201cworld\u2019s busiest salesman of movie stills,\u201d and stated that the market information Klaw accumulated amounted to \u201ca box-office barometer for Hollywood.\u201d [15] [#N15] Famed Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper even used Klaw\u2019s sales numbers as fodder to stir up star controversies.

At a public meeting of the New England Comparative Effectiveness Public Advisory Council in March 2021, a majority of panelists considered belimumab, at current pricing, to have \"high\" long-term value for money: the estimated annual price for belimumab was $US43 000 under ICER\u2019s recommended health-benefit price benchmark (HBPB) range of $45 000-$61 000 per year.

The new edition takes pains to bookend the four years of the Trump administration, documenting in detail the good (\"one-in, two-out,\" etc.) and bad (trade, antitrust, price controls, AI, leave policy, \"space force,\" etc.) from a classical liberal or ordered laissez-faire perspective. It also addresses regulation subtracted and added due to the Covid-19 virus. *Agencies\u2019 stated priorities and \u201cinventories\u201d of rules were warning signs for Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda all along. While the Trump administration claimed to have met internal goals of implementing a \u201cone-in, two-out\u201d process for federal regulations and freezing costs, the longer horizon signaled agencies poised to reverse course and to issue substantially more regulatory actions than deregulatory ones. That impulse to regulation is unencumbered under Biden\u2019s new executive directives to agencies. Federal government spending, deficits, and the national debt are staggering, but so is the impact of federal regulations. Unfortunately, the financial impact of these rules gets little attention in policy debates because, unlike spending and taxes, they are unbudgeted and impossible to quantify, a condition discussed in detail in the report. That circumstance is the reason cost-benefit analysis (little of which exists regardless) and administrative state excesses must be replaced with congressional accountability for regulatory lawmaking. Steps for more review, transparency, and accountability for new and existing federal regulations are also detailed Highlights from the 2021 edition include: * Apart from sector-specific executive orders and memoranda, the report details seven prominent ways the Trump administration streamlined regulation. Among them, and bookending four years of \u201cone-in, two- out\u201d for federal regulatory actions as prescribed by his Executive Order 13771, \u201cReducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs,\u201d the claimed FY 2020 \"out/in\" ratio was 3.2 to 1 (and 1.3 to 1 if only significant deregulatory actions were counted). * President Trump\u2019s unique regulatory streamlining was offset by his own actions and favorable comments or lob bying for regulatory intervention in the following areas: --Antitrust --Hospital and pharmaceutical price transparency mandates and price controls --Speech and social media content regulation --Private sector privacy regs, encryption, and algorithm regulation --Gov't threats to privacy: amplified databases, biometrics, and surveillance --Online taxes (which are regulatory) --Bipartisan large-scale infrastructure spending with regulatory effects --Trade restrictions --Farm bill and agricultural intervention --Subsidies with regulatory effects --Telecommunications interventions, including for 5G infrastructure --Personal liberties incursions: health tracking, vaping, supplements, and firearms --Financial regulation --Industrial policy in frontier sectors, such as scientific research, artificial intelligence, and the creation of the Space Force --Novel welfare and labor regulations --COVID-related regulation as opposed to deregulation * Given the limited available federal government data and reports, and contemporary studies\u2014and the federal government\u2019s failure to provide a required regularly updated estimate of the aggregate costs of regulation\u2014this report maintains a placeholder for regulatory compliance and effects of federal intervention of $2 trillion annually. It does so for purposes of context and rudimentary comparison with federal spending, debt, GDP, household budgets and other economic metrics. For example, the regulatory hidden \u201ctax\u201d rivals federal individual and corporate income tax receipts combined, which totaled $2.076 trillion in 2020 ($1.812 trillion in individual income tax revenues and $264 billion in corporate income tax revenues). Regulatory costs rival corporate pretax profits of $2.237 trillion. Alongside, the report also outlines the vast sweep of intervention and policies for which costs are disregarded and unfathomed. * Calendar year 2020 concluded with 3,353 final rules in the Federal Register, up from 2019\u2019s 2,964 final rules, which was the lowest count since records began being kept in the 1970s and is the only ever tally below 3,000. (In the 1990s and early 2000s, rule counts regularly exceeded 4,000 annually.) An additional 202 Trump administration rules were added between New Year\u2019s Day and Inauguration Day 2021. * During calendar year 2020, while agencies issued those 3,353 rules (some of them deregulatory), Congress enacted \u201conly\u201d 178 laws. Thus, agencies is- sued 19 rules for every law enacted by Congress. This \u201cUnconstitutionality Index\u201d\u2014the ratio of regulations issued by agencies to laws passed by Congress and signed by the president\u2014highlights the entrenched delegation of lawmaking power to unelected agency officials. The average ratio for the previous decade was 28. * In 2017, Trump\u2019s first year, the Fed- eral Register finished at 61,308 pages, the lowest count since 1993 and a 36 percent drop from President Barack Obama\u2019s 95,894 pages, which had been the highest level in history. The 2020 Federal Register tally rose to 86,356 pages, which is the second-highest count ever. However, Trump\u2019s rollbacks of rules\u2014and historically there are still fewer rules overall\u2014also necessarily added to rather than subtract from the Register. * Alongside the 3,353 rules finalized in calendar year 2020, there is also the flow in the pipeline itself to consider. According to the fall 2020 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, 69 federal departments, agencies, and commissions had 3,852 regulatory actions in the pipeline at various stages of implementation (recently completed, active, and long- term stages). Of the 3,852 rules, 653 had been deemed \u201cDeregulatory\u201d via Trump\u2019s now-defunct Executive Order 13771, This designation has vanished under Biden. Of the 3,852 regulations in the Agenda\u2019s pipeline (completed, active, and long- term stages), 261 were \u201ceconomically significant\u201d rules, which the federal government describes as having annual economic effects of $100 million or more. Of those 261 rules, 36 were deemed deregulatory for purposes of Trump\u2019s now-cancelled Executive Order 13771. Since 1993, when the first edition of Ten Thousand Commandments was published, agencies have issued 111,065 rules.

In March, the amount dropped by more than 50% from nearly $200 million to around $100 million.\n The effect on funding for education and other social services and infrastructure is significant. For example, the state\u2019s 2-year budget included distribution of half of the total projected revenues, nearly $5 billion, to school districts and localities where the oil is being produced, i.e., the Bakken region.\n The rising unemployment rate in the state, which collects individual income taxes, will stifle budgets further. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 8.5% unemployment in April, up from rates ranging from 2 to 2.4% over the previous 5 months.\n North Dakota\u2019s revenue drop pales in comparison to Texas. The state\u2019s oil and natural gas industry paid more than $16 billion in state and local taxes and state royalties last year, which was the highest total since tracking of the amount began in 2007 by the Texas Oil & Gas Association. Its report in January showed the 2019 amount surpassed the previous record of $15.66 billion paid in 2014. As recently as 2016, the revenue was $9.44 billion, and increased to $14 billion in 2018.\n During a conference call in April, the association\u2019s President Todd Staples, said, \u201cWith production strained by prices, we may have additional bankruptcies and mergers and acquisitions as companies work to maintain a competitive [advantage]. Job growth may continue to lag further than we\u2019ve enjoyed in recent years.\u201d\n The Texas state comptroller Glenn Hegar said in April about 54% of the state\u2019s general revenue during the current 2-year period would come from sales taxes. Although that\u2019s the largest share of the general revenue, oil production taxes were forecast to account for 6.1%, and natural gas production taxes another 2.7%.\n In March, when the early effects of COVID-19 and the oil-price crash hit, Hegar said in a statement, \u201cCertainly, Texas has exposure if oil prices remain depressed for a sustained period of time, and slowdowns in economic activity related to the COVID-19 outbreak could also be a headwind. We are still only 6 months into the current budget cycle, however, and it is too early to tell with certainty how current fluctuations will impact long-term economic performance and state revenues.\u201d\n However, in May, Hegar\u2019s office reported the oil production tax in Texas generated 75% less revenue for the state than last May, and the natural gas production tax was 76% less. All said, tax revenue from all sources was about 50% less than the same month a year ago.\n Cutbacks in budgets and spending extend far beyond those announced by operators and service companies soon after the oil-price drop in March. Our industry is by no means the only industry struggling and adapting. But when our industry falters, in this case during a sudden price drop combined with a pandemic, the dominoes topple quickly across related industries, individuals, governments, and society.

While the Trump administration can be said to have technically met the goal of implementing a \u201cone-in, two-out\u201d process for federal regulations over the past three years taken as a whole, the longer-term horizon plainly shows agencies poised to reverse this and to issue substantially more regulatory actions than deregulatory ones. \n \n\u2022 Some warning signs are of Trump\u2019s own creation. President Trump\u2019s regulatory streamlining is being offset by his own favorable comments and explicit actions toward regulatory intervention in the following areas: \n \n- Antitrust intervention \n- Financial regulation \n- Hospital and pharmaceutical price transparency mandates and price controls \n- Speech and social media regulation \n\u2013 Tech regulation \n\u2013 Digital taxes \n\u2013 Bipartisan large-scale infrastructure spending with regulatory effects \n\u2013 Trade restrictions \n\u2013 Farming and agriculture \n\u2013 Subsidies with regulatory effect \n\u2013 Telecommunications regulation, including for 5G infrastructure \n\u2013 Personal liberties: health-tracking, vaping, supplements, and firearms \n\u2013 Industrial policy or market socialist funding mechanisms (in scientific research, artificial intelligence, and a Space Force) \n\u2013 Welfare and labor regulations (job training, the new family leave) \n \n\u2022 Given the limited available federal government data and reports, as well as contemporary studies -- and the federal government\u2019s failure to provide a regularly updated estimate of the aggregate costs of regulation -- this report employs a placeholder estimate for regulatory compliance and economic effects of federal intervention of $1.9 trillion annually. This is for purposes of context and rudimentary comparison with federal spending and other economic metrics. This report also presents an outline of the vast sweep of intervention and policies for which costs are disregarded. \n \n\u2022 The burden of regulatory intervention is equivalent to over 40 percent of the level of federal spending, projected to be $4.6 trillion in 2020. \n \n\u2022 Regulatory costs of $1.9 trillion amount to 9 percent of U.S. GDP, which was estimated at $21.54 trillion in 2019 by the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis. \n \n\u2022 When regulatory costs are combined with estimated federal FY 2019 outlays of $4.447 trillion, the federal government\u2019s share of the entire economy reaches 30 percent (state and local spending and regulation would add to that). \n \n\u2022 If it were a country, U.S. regulation would be the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy (not counting the U.S. itself), ranking behind Italy and ahead of Brazil. \n \n\u2022 The regulatory hidden \u201ctax\u201d is equivalent to federal individual and corporate income tax receipts combined, which totaled $1.914 trillion in 2019 ($1.698 trillion in individual income tax revenues and $216 billion in corporate income tax revenues). \n \n\u2022 Regulatory costs rival corporate pretax profits of $2.063 trillion. \n \n\u2022 If one assumed that all costs of federal regulation and intervention flowed all the way down to households, U.S. households would \u201cpay\u201d $14,455 annually on average in a regulatory hidden tax. \n \n\u2022 Calendar year 2019 ended with 2,964 final rules in the Federal Register, which was the lowest count since records began being kept in the 1970s and is the only sub-3,000 tally ever. \n \n\u2022 During calendar year 2019, while agencies issued those 2,964 rules, Congress enacted \u201conly\u201d 105 laws. Thus, agencies issued 28 rules for every law enacted by Congress. This \u201cUnconstitutionality Index\u201d\u2014the ratio of regulations issued by agencies to laws passed by Congress and signed by the president\u2014highlights the entrenched delegation of lawmaking power to unelected agency officials. As it happens, the average ratio for the past decade has also been 28. \n \n\u2022 In 2017, Trump\u2019s first year, the Federal Register finished at 61,308 pages, the lowest count since 1993 and a 36 percent drop from President Barack Obama\u2019s 95,894 pages, which had been the highest level in history. The 2019 Federal Register tally rose to 70,938 pages. However, Trump\u2019s rollbacks of rules\u2014and as noted there are far fewer rules overall\u2014also necessarily add to rather than subtract from the Register. \n \n\u2022 Of the 3,752 regulations in the Agenda\u2019s pipeline (completed, active, and longterm stages), 192 are \u201ceconomically significant\u201d rules, which the federal government describes as having annual economic effects of $100 million or more. Of those 192 rules, 33 are deemed deregulatory for purposes of Trump Executive Order 13771 (11 at the completed stage, 20 at the active stage). 644 affect small businesses. \n \n\u2022 Since 1993, when the first edition of Ten Thousand Commandments was published, agencies have issued 107,712 rules. Since the Federal Register first began itemizing them in 1976, 204,802 final rules have been issued. \n \n\u2022 President Trump issued 47 executive orders in 2019 (after 63 in 2017 and 35 in 2018). From the nation\u2019s founding through the Obama administration, more than 15,285 executive orders have been issued. President Obama issued a total of 276, similar to President George W. Bush\u2019s 291. Prior to the 20th century, most presidents had no more than a few dozen. In contrast, Woodrow Wilson issued 1,803, Coolidge issued 1,204, and Franklin D. Roosevelt issued 3,467.

A main turning point was the Pilot Program for Protection of the Tropical Forests of Brazil (PPG7) which was implemented with the fi nancial aid of developed countries. From the second half of the 1990s, however, not only conservation projects in Amazonia but also developmental projects in Cerrado have been supported by stable domestic economies and widespread neoliberalism. The development drive has centered upon infrastructure constructions which promote exporting meat and soybeans. At a local level, the Secretariat of State for Rural Production consists of sections for both development and conservation \u2013 family farmer assistance and environmental protection \u2013 and the state government for environmental protection segregates the full protection units and the sustainable use units through Ecological-Economic Zoning. Meanwhile, environmental NGOs in various communities have experimented with agroforestry. The relay harvesting of nonwood products helps to increase the biomass and species richness. It is hoped that the local governments will continue to cooperate with agroforestry NGOs in order to raise the behaviors of small farmers. 1. A multilateral approach to the Amazon Except for the rubber boom period from 1887 to 1917, it was the second half of the 20 century when large-scale developments flourished in Brazilian Amazonia (Costa, 1989). The military governments strongly executed the developments, and brought about huge forest Figure 1. Annual and cumulative deforestation areas in Legal Amazon from 1988 to 2018. Annual data is not obtained from 1970 to 1987, but the cumulative area amounts to 355,000 km.

It has been simulated that the percentage of deforestation will reach 40% in the middle of this century (Carvalho et al., 2001, Laurance et al., 2001, Soares-Filho et al., 2004, 2006). Brazilian government officials have believed \u201cthe Frontier Theory\u201d that the fortunes sleeping in the five million km of Amazonia should be utilized for improving the standards of living of Brazilians. The objective of the present study is chronologically overviewing the rapid developments, and commenting both on the efforts made toward environmental conservation since the 1990s, and on the dilemma between conservation and development. For the most part, the alterations made to Amazonian rainforests have been discussed from ecological and earth environmental viewpoints (Nepstad et al., 1999, Davidson et al., 2012). Road constructions and settlements have been executed to support the lumber, meat, and mine industries, but the developments were forced to change to conservation due to the hyper-inflation in the late 1980s and because of criticism from foreign countries against the devastating deforestations. Consequently, from the first half of the 1990s international organizations launched a variety of conservation projects. In the meantime, the development front has just moved to the Cerrado where meat and soybeans are produced on a massive scale, and the infrastructure constructions have been steadily conducted in order to export the agricultural products (Carvalho et al., 2002). Also, agroforestry has gradually germinated at the level of environmental NGOs. All of these phenomena should be considered, including poli t ical , economic, and social aspects during the past 50 years (Alves et al., 2008). 2. Changes in policies concerning Amazonia (1) Development activities in Amazonia The first president to seriously be proactive toward inland developments was Get\u00falio Dornelles Vargas. He founded the Superintendency of Economic Recovery Plan for the Amazon (SPEVEA) in 1953 in order to make use of largely untouched lands. Then, President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira moved the capital to Bras\u00edlia, 1,000 km into the interior from Rio de Janeiro, in the Target Plan of 1960. Thereafter, the construction of interstate highways started between southern Figure 2. The Legal Amazon (created by the author). Name of STATEs, Capitals, main rivers, and interstate roads. Local cities which appear in this paper are 1: Caraj\u00e1s, 2: Tucuru\u00ed, 3: Gurup\u00e1, 4: Altamira, 5: Santar\u00e9m, 6: Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7\u00fa, 7: Camet\u00e1, 8: Epitaciol\u00e2ndia, 9: Brasil\u00e9ia, 10: Silves, 11: Manicor\u00e9. 61 \u904e\u53bb50\u5e74\u306e\u30a2\u30de\u30be\u30f3\u306e\u958b\u767a\u3068\u4fdd\u5168\u306e\u8a66\u307f Brazil and Amazonia. The new highways included BR010 from Bras\u00edlia to Bel\u00e9m at the mouth of the Amazon River, and BR364 from Cuiab\u00e1 to Porto Velho in western Amazonia (Figure 2). Then, a military coup occurred in 1964, and a long dark age continued until 1985, but infrastructure developments in Amazonia advanced during the period. In 1966, President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco initiated the Amazon Operation, aiming for stronger border defenses of northern territories. He reorganized the SPEVEA into the Superintendency for Development of Amazon (SUDAM), and set up the area called Legal Amazon, and founded the Bank of Amazonia. The following year, he specified Manaus to be a duty-free city, establishing the Superintendency of Free Trade Zone of Manaus (SUFRAMA). Through these reforms, he intended to concentrate people, goods, and money into Manaus (Castello Branco, 1991). In 1968, President Artur da Costa e Silva set up tax incentives for agriculture and livestock farming to support settlements and cattle grazing in Amazonia. The 1970s was a decade for implementing them. President Em\u00edlio Garrastazu M\u00e9dici started the Program of National Integration-I (1970-1974), and the construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway (BR230) started. In the Program of Redistributive Land Reform (1970), the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) started settlement of 400,000 people from Northeast Brazil to Eastern Amazonia under the slogan \u201cA land without people for people without land\u201d. Small towns were established such as Agrovilla, Agr\u00f3polis, and Rur\u00f3polis, and agricultural production began to fl ourish. However, the federal government\u2019s project, which had aimed to settle a million people into Amazonia, changed into a large-scale development. President Ernesto Beckmann Geisel executed the Program of Growth Pole Development of AgricultureStock Farming and Agriculture-Mining in Figure 3. Fifteen development poles in the \u201cPolamazonia\u201d, where 1: Xingu-Araguaia, 2: Caraj\u00e1s, 3: Araguaia-Tocantins, 4: Trombetas, 5: Altamira, 6: Pr\u00e9-Amaz\u00f4nia Maranhense, 7: Rond\u00f4nia, 8: Acre, 9: Juru\u00e1-Solim\u00f5es, 10: Roraima, 11: Tapaj\u00f3s, 12: Amap\u00e1, 13: Juruena, 14: Aripuan\u00e3, 15: Maraj\u00f3 (referred to Conselho de Desenvolvimento Econ\u00f4mico (1974)). 62 \u571f \u8c37 \u5f70 \u7537 Amazonia (Polamaz\u00f4nia) to carry out growth pole developments in 15 places throughout Amazonia from 1975 to 1980 (Figure 3). In the 1980s, the scale of developments expanded. President Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo started the Great Caraj\u00e1s Project in which strip mining for iron mines was carried out in Caraj\u00e1s in eastern Par\u00e1 (as for the location, see No. 1 of Figure 2). Itaqui Port in S\u00e3o Luis was expanded for exporting iron ore. The Caraj\u00e1s Railway was constructed between the two cities, and the Tucuru\u00ed Hydroelectric Power Station (No. 2 of Fig. 2) was constructed. A number of steelmakers, the World Bank, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency financially supported the project. In western Amazonia, agricultural entrepreneurs were settled around Mato Grosso and Rond\u00f4nia States through the Program of Integrated Development of Northwestern Brazil (Polonoroeste, 1981-1985) (Bartoli, 2010). After the military government collapsed in 1985, President Jos\u00e9 Sarney de Ara\u00fajo Costa set up the Northern Border Project for the purposes of national defense, the management of indigenous people, preventing smuggling, and supporting gold miners (garimpeiro) in the northern territories, which has an area of 1.4 million km. Also, his government aimed to construct 80 hydroelectric dams and pipelines of natural gas in anticipation of future demands in Amazonia. (2) Conservation activities in Amazonia The huge deforestat ion of Amazonian rainforests came to be seen as a problem by developed countries in the second half of the 1980s, in which logging and pasture expansions, mining, and dam developments were criticized (Fearnside, 1991). Price inflation terribly rose, and Brazil failed in the IMF-led framework, because of the second oil shock in 1979 and because of the foreign debt crisis in Mexico in 1982. In 1987, the Sarney Administration announced a moratorium on interest payments of 63 \u904e\u53bb50\u5e74\u306e\u30a2\u30de\u30be\u30f3\u306e\u958b\u767a\u3068\u4fdd\u5168\u306e\u8a66\u307f foreign debts. The government-led and foreigndependent development models collapsed, and the development of Amazonia was forced to shift to conservation policies in the form of succumbing to the demands of developed countries. It was the same year when the World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission) submitted a report (Our Common Future) to the United Nat ions, where the sustainable development was shared among the UN member countries (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987). T h e S a r n e y A d m i n i s t r a t i o n p u t t h e environmental provisions (Article 225) into the new constitution, promulgated in 1988, and set up the National Council of Environment (CONAMA).

Focusing primarily on two of the Midwest\u2019s most illustrious politicians, Minnesota\u2019s Eugene McCarthy and South Dakota\u2019s George McGovern, the book is a peon to the honesty, dedication, and patriotism of these two senators. Both men sought to take on the establishment and throw themselves wholly into the eff ort to end the tragedy of the Vietnam War. Th e fi rst section of the book aptly starts with the hardhitting posters of the civil rights movement, then the psychedelic posters advertising rock and roll bands in the midsixties (\u201cPsychedelic posters were in many respects art nouveau on acid\u201d [10]), and fi nishes with the stirring inyourface posters of the antiwar movement. Th ese three themes of poster art culminated in the expressive and emotional posters created for Senator Eugene McCarthy\u2019s 1968 campaign for president. Th roughout the book Wert convincingly argues that the heyday, both politically and most importantly aesthetically, of campaign posters was the heyday of psychedelic art. Of course the period about which he writes was an extraordinary period in all ways\u2014 musically, artistically, even stylewise\u2014 as a generation sought new, creative ways not only of expressing dissenting political views, but also to live life authentically. Aft er the sections on the McCarthy and McGovern posters that comprise the bulk of the book, he deals with post1972 campaign posters and the decline of the creative dynamism that characterized the artists of the rebellious sixties. It was the Obama candidacy of 2008 that reinvigorated political campaign posters as the hope generated by Obama spawned enthusiasm among poster artists. Th e year produced the fi nest posters since 1972. Although Wert gives some historical context in introductory comments to each section, his emphasis is primarily on the artists and the aesthetics of the posters. Some of the artists are internationally famous\u2014 Alexander Calder, Ben Shahn, Andy Warhol, Larry Rivers, and others\u2014 but most are journeymen artists and for price stability left \u201ctwo key legacies: an early form of collective marketing and close CanadaUK coordination\u201d (48). Magnan traces how these legacies helped to shape the creation of prairie agricultural policy prioritizing government involvement in grain marketing. Additionally, the development of the British milling and breadbaking industry, beginning with the introduction of roller mills that made it possible to process Canada\u2019s famous Red Fife wheat, was a critical factor in why British buyers sought Canadian grain and in turn how Canadian agricultural policy took British needs into account. Th e United Kingdom was the fi rst major customer for Canadian wheat and Magnan argues that even aft er the majority of Canadian sales shift ed to other markets, the longstanding relationship with UK buyers allowed the CWB to experiment with alternative sales agreements for highquality grain notably with the British baker Warburtons. Th e detailed discussion of how this contract was serviced alone makes this book worth reading. Th e success of the Warburtons agreement resulted in the CWB\u2019s introduction of identitypreserve programs for other Canadian grain types. Th e British also adopted this system for some contracts in their domestic grain market. Later, this qualityassurance focus became important during the Canadian debates over introducing genetically modifi ed herbicidetolerant wheat into the Canadian system. At present, this book provides one of the better overviews of the last 30 years of grain marketing policy on the Canadian prairies and highlights how these domestic policies were the result of not just internal social changes, but were also aff ected by the place of Canadian grain in the international market. As it is relatively short, the book is forgivably weaker on public plantbreeding and agricultural practices but touches on them enough to make it apparent how they are involved in the larger narrative. Magnan makes a strong case that prairie agricultural policy cannot be understood in isolation from the markets the prairies served.", "authors": ["R.

Output will rise to 13.29 million B/D next year.\n Similarly, the International Energy Agency predicted last month that US shale oil production will continue to reshape world energy markets, with the US accounting for 85% of the increase in global oil production to 2030. US output will rise to 19 million B/D over the next decade, wresting additional market share from OPEC producers and Russia, according to the agency\u2019s annual World Energy Outlook.\n But while shale will continue to affect global markets, some believe this predicted rate of growth may be optimistic. There are already signs that producers are curtailing spending and production in the major shale basins as they are under increasing pressure to focus more on capital discipline and returns rather than production growth. In contrast to the EIA and IEA, consultancy IHS Markit sees much slower growth in US shale next year, just a 440,000 B/D increase, with output flat in 2021.\n \u201cGoing from nearly 2 million B/D annual growth in 2018, an all-time global record, to essentially no growth by 2021 makes it pretty clear that this is a new era of moderation for shale producers,\u201d said Raoul LeBlanc, IHS Markit vice president for North American unconventionals. \u201cThis is a dramatic shift after several years where annual growth of more than 1 million B/D was the norm.\u201d\n IHS Markit predicts prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to hover in the $50/bbl range and that capital spending will drop by 10% this year, 12% in 2021, and 8% in 2022, from $102 billion in 2019 to $83 billion in 2022. Prices need to be about $65/bbl for producers to be able to both increase production significantly while also satisfying shareholder expectations, it said.\n In the meantime, producers are focusing more on completing wells than drilling new ones, which is a more economical way of boosting output. There were 7,740 drilled but uncompleted wells in the seven major US shale regions at the end of September, according to the EIA, compared with 8,800 in January.\n After years of producing all out, pushing US oil and natural gas production to record levels, shale producers are pulling back. Although output has skyrocketed, particularly in places such as the Permian Basin, financial results have not. Mergers and bankruptcy filings are common, and investors have become reluctant to lend capital.\n Natural gas companies in particular are hurting, and they are promising more capital discipline and lower production going forward.

Knowing the variety of vehicles in the image can be useful for further evaluation in a huge variety of applications. In this venture we propose a simple technique for determining the wide variety of vehicle in an image. Existing strategies contain counting based totally on location of car, color of the vehicle, making use of part detection strategies etc. This mission work also goals at figuring out the right value of density by clearing the vehicle touching the borders of the image. In this challenge the usage of MATLAB with image processing toolbox the count and density values are calculated and estimating the proper count. Automatic detecting and monitoring vehicles in video surveillance records is a totally tough thing in computer vision with essential practical programs, along with traffic evaluation and security. Manually reviewing the large amount of facts they generate is frequently impractical. Thus, algorithms for reading video which require little or no human enter is a scientific answer. Video surveillance structures are focused on monitoring, moving vehicle classification and tracking. A car tracking and classification system is described as one that could categorize transferring vehicles and similarly classifies that into various categories. Traffic control and statistics structures rely mainly on sensors for estimating the visitors parameters.", "authors": [], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2019}, "6": {"title": "An Efficient Way Of Detecting Numbers In Car License Plate Using Neural Network Training With GA", "abstract": "Numbers in vehicle license plate LP is unique and essential.

The gun is usually a light metal casting held together by rivets through the grip, cylinder, and barrel. By removing the barrel rivet and inserting a piece of car radio antenna, taping the original barrel so that it firmly holds the tubing in place and providing a firing pin, one has a weapon capable of firing live ammunition. If the tubing does not fit tightly enough, it may have to be soldered into position. A firing pin may be added to the hammer by drilling a small hole through it and screwing in a selftapping screw. Some weapons examined in New York City simply had the face of the hammer filed to a crude point. If the shooter finds that his gun misfires quite often, he may strengthen the hammer spring by wrapping rubber bands around the frame and the back of the hammer. This serves to add more snap to the hammer fall. When such a modification is made, the double action trigger pull is eliminated by removing the entire trigger and sear. The shooter then cocks the hammer back with his thumb and releases it when he wishes to fire. Most cap pistols can be cocked back farther with the thumb than by pulling the trigger. Thus a longer hammer fall is achieved, and this increases the momentum and striking energy imparted to the firing pin. If a gun that is modified in this way is dry fired the firing pin could snap off due to the brittleness of the cast alloy, or the hammer could snap off at the thinnest part of the shaft. The heavy blows of the pin against the weak metal of the tube barrel may damage the mouth of the chamber to such an extent that no test cartridges can then be chambered. If the weapon must be tested, only .22 B.B. Caps should be used to see whether the weapon is capable of discharging a bulleted load. Anything that has a heavier bullet or powder charge may destroy the casting and injure the investigator. If it is only necessary to test the serviceability of the weapon, that is, whether or not it will fire a live cartridge, either use a blank load or pull the bullet from a bulleted load and test with the primer only. If soft copperblanks or B.B. Caps are used to test for serviceability, they may not give a valid test of whether the same gun will fire harder brass cartridges. If brass cartridges are found in the possession of an accused, this hardness factor could be important. The typical cap pistol that is altered in this manner has no extractor or ejector yet the shell often does eject by straight blowback against the hammer. However, the construction of the gun may be such that the hammer cannot make a full enough rotation to clear the shell in its rearward movement. If the hammer is subject to battering very often, it is liable to snap of at its weakest point. The piece that breaks could jam into the slot in the frame, but more likely it will be left at the scene of the crime and will match the shaft left in the weapon. The break often will not occur with \"standard\" velocity .22 short cartridges or when .22 B.B. Caps or C.B. Caps are used as the pressure is too low. As with the first weapons discussed in this article, the converted cap pistol has an ill-fitting bore and much of the gas is lost. If the hammer fall is particularly light the trigger may have to be pulled several times or the hammer may have to be cocked and dropped more than once. The rim will show multiple strike impressions placed close together or overlapping, especially if the bore is loose and the cartridge is free to rotate in the chamber with each blow.", "authors": ["B.

This article uses an autoethnographic lens to discuss my experience of a serious car crash my family and I were inadvertently involved in due to police negligence and a criminal act. Employing Creative Analytical Practice (CAP) ethnography, a reflexive form of research which recognises that the creative process, producer and product are \u201cdeeply intertwined\u201d (Richardson,\u00a0\u201cWriting: A Method\u201d\u00a0930), I investigate how the crash\u2019s violent affects crippled my agency, manifested in my creative praxis and catalysed my identification of latent forms of institutionalised violence in film culture, its discourse and pedagogy that also contributed to my inertia. The article maps my process of writing a feature length screenplay during the aftermath of the crash as I set out to articulate my story of survival and resistance. Using this narrative inquiry, in which we can \u201cinvestigate how we construct the world, ourselves, and others, and how standard objectifying practices...unnecessarily limit us\u201d (Richardson,\u00a0\u201cWriting: A Method\u201d\u00a0924), I outline how I attempted to disrupt the entrenched power structures that exist in dominant narratives of violence in film and challenge my subjugated positioning as a woman within this canon. I describe my engagement with the deconstructionist practices of writing the body and militant feminist cinema, which suggest subversive opportunities for women\u2019s self-determination by encouraging us to embrace our exiled positioning in dominant discourse through creative experimentation, and identify some of the possibilities and limitations of this for female agency. Drawing on CAP ethnography, existentialism, film feminism, and narrative reframing, I assert that these reconstructive practices are more effective for the creative enfranchisement of women by not relegating us to the periphery of social systems and cultural forms. Instead, they enable us to speak back to violent structures in a language that has greater social access, context and impact.My strong desire to tell screen stories lies in my belief that storytelling is a crucial evolutionary mechanism of resilience. Narratives do not simply represent the social world but also have the ability to change it by enabling us to \u201ctry to figure out how to live our lives meaningfully\u201d (Ellis 760). This conviction has been directly influenced by my personal story of trauma and survival when myself, my siblings, and our respective life partners became involved in a major car crash. Two police officers attending to a drunken brawl in an inner city park had, in their haste, left the keys in the ignition of their vehicle. We were travelling across a major intersection when the police car, which had subsequently been stolen by a man involved in the brawl \u2013 a man who was wanted on parole, had a blood alcohol level three times over the legal limit, and was driving at speeds exceeding 110kms per hour - ran a red light and crossed our path, causing us to crash into his vehicle. From the impact, the small four-wheel drive we were travelling in was catapulted metres into the air, rolling numerous times before smashing head on into oncoming traffic. My heavily pregnant sister was driving our vehicle.The incident attracted national media attention and our story became a sensationalist spectacle. Each news station reported erroneous and conflicting information, one stating that my sister had lost her unborn daughter, another even going so far as to claim my sister had died in the crash. This tabloidised, \u2018if it bleeds, it leads\u2019, culture of journalism, along with new digital technologies, encourages and facilitates the normalisation of violent acts, often inflicted on women. Moreover, in their pursuit of high-rating stories, news bodies motivate dehumanising acts of citizen journalism that see witnesses often inspired to film, rather than assist, victims involved in a violent event. Through a connection with someone working for a major news station, we discovered that leading news broadcasters had bought a tape shot by a group of men who call themselves the \u2018Paparazzi of Perth\u2019. These men were some of the first on the scene and began filming us from only a few metres away while we were still trapped upside down and unconscious in our vehicle. In the recording, the men are heard laughing and celebrating our tragedy as they realise the lucrative possibilities of the shocking imagery they are capturing as witnesses pull us out of the back of the car, and my pregnant sister incredibly frees herself from the wreckage by kicking out the window.As a female filmmaker, I saw the bitter irony of this event as the camera was now turned on me and my loved ones at our most vulnerable. In her discussion of the male gaze, a culturally sanctioned form of narrational violence against women that is ubiquitous in most mainstream media, Mulvey proposes that women are generally the passive image, trapped by the physical limits of the frame in a permanent state of powerlessness as our identity is reduced to her \u201cto-be-looked-at-ness\u201d (40). For a long period of time, the experience of performing the role of this commodified woman of a weaponised male gaze, along with the threat of annihilation associated with our near-death experience, immobilised my spirit. I felt I belonged \u201cmore to the dead than to the living\u201d (Herman 34). When I eventually returned to my creative praxis, I decided to use scriptwriting as both my \u201cmode of reasoning and a mode of representation\u201d (Richardson, Writing Strategies 21), test whether I could work through my feelings of alienation and violation and reclaim my agency. This was a complex and harrowing task because my memories \u201clack[ed] verbal narrative and context\u201d (Herman 38) and were deeply rooted in my body. Cixous confirms that for women, \u201cwriting and voice...are woven together\u201d and \u201cspring from the deepest layers of her psyche\u201d (Moi 112). For many months, I struggled to write. I attempted to block out this violent ordeal and censor my self. I soon learnt, however, that my body could not be silenced and was slow to forget. As I tried to write around this experience, the trauma worked itself deeper inside of me, and my physical symptoms worsened, as did the quality of my writing.In the early version of the screenplay I found myself writing a female-centred film about violence, identity and death, using the fictional narrative to express the numbness I experienced. I wrote the female protagonist with detachment as though she were an object devoid of agency. Sartre claims that we make objects of others and of ourselves in an attempt to control the uncertainty of life and the ever-changing nature of humanity (242). Making something into an object is to deprive it of life (and death); it is our attempt to keep ourselves \u2018safe\u2019. While I recognise that the car crash\u2019s reminder of my mortality was no doubt part of the reason why I rendered myself, and the script\u2019s female protagonist, lifeless as agentic beings, I sensed that there were subtler operations of power and control behind my self-objectification and self-censorship, which deeply concerned me. What had influenced this dea(r)th of female agency in my creative imaginings? Why did I write my female character with such a red pen? Why did I seem so compelled to \u2018kill\u2019 her? I wanted to investigate my gender construction, the complex relationship between my scriptwriting praxis, and the context within which it is produced to discover whether I could write a different future for myself, and my female characters. Kiesinger supports \u201ccontextualizing our stories within the framework of a larger picture\u201d (108), so as to remain open to the possibility that there might not be anything \u2018wrong\u2019 with us, per se, \u201cbut rather something very wrong with the dynamics that dominate the communicative system\u201d (109) within which we operate: in the case of my creative praxis, the oppressive structures present in the culture of film and its pedagogy.Pulling FocusWomen are supposed to be the view and when the view talks back, it is uncomfortable.\u2014 Jane Campion (Filming Desire)It is a terrible thing to see that no one has ever taught us how to develop our vision as women neither in the history of arts nor in film schools.\u2014 Marie Mandy (Filming Desire)The democratisation of today\u2019s media landscape through new technologies, the recent rise in female-run production companies (Zemler) in Hollywood, along with the ground-breaking #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements has elevated the global consciousness of gender-based violence, and has seen the screen industry seek to redress its history of gender imbalance. While it is too early to assess the impact these developments may have on women\u2019s standing in film, today the \u2018celluloid ceiling\u2019 still operates on multiple levels of indoctrination and control through a systemic pattern of exclusion for women that upholds the \u201cnearly seamless dialogue among men in cinema\u201d (Lauzen, Thumbs Down 2). Female filmmakers occupy a tenuous position of influence in the mainstream industry and things are not any better on the other side of the camera (Lauzen, The Celluloid Ceiling). For the most part, Hollywood\u2019s male gaze and penchant for sexualising and (physically or figuratively) killing female characters, which normalises violence against women and is \u201calmost inversely proportional to the liberation of women in society\u201d (Mandy), continues to limit women to performing as the image rather than the agent on screen.Film funding bodies and censorship boards, mostly comprised of men, remain exceptionally averse to independent female filmmakers who go against the odds to tell their stories, which often violate taboos about femininity and radically redefine female agency through the construction of the female gaze: a narrational technique of resistance that enables reel w", "authors": ["Larissa Sexton-Finck"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2020}}, "32": {"0": {"title": "BORED GHOSTS AND ANXIOUS TEXT GAMES: HOW DATING APPS ALGORITHMICALLY\n CHANNEL THE DESIRE FOR INTIMACY INTO ANXIOUS ENGAGEMENT", "abstract": "This article presents two findings from 50 in-depth interviews of\n daters using OkCupid, Tinder, and Bumble.

Our main point is that autonomic computing makes effective design of the user experience even more challenging and critical than it is now.

Furthermore, this method can reduce 40% of the information quantity compared with ghost imaging while the qualities of reconstructing the information are the same.

The methodological perspective does not require one to think of different actors as equals in terms of their ability to act or in moral terms. But it does highlight that, in the case of e-scooters, there are many different forces at play beyond e-scooters and their users. One is sidewalks: their quality, quantity, continuity, or even their absence. A second is governmental transportation policy and the priorities for investment directed toward automobile facilities in urban areas, instead of relatively cheaper alternatives such as protected bike lanes that could be shared with e-scooters. And a third is the lithium-ion battery, the technological force powering everything from e-scooters to AirPods, and the ecosystems that it acidifies [3]. This cursory analysis indicates how structures\u2014physical ones such as sidewalks, social ones such as policy, and combinations of the two such as battery supply chains\u2014play a role in the trajectories of technologies like e-scooters. In the case of e-scooters, it\u2019s easy to observe the presence of scooters and the behavior of users, and one can use the tools of ANT to better understand the technology\u2019s entanglements. But studying absence is another question. Before shared e-scooter programs existed, where were scooters not being ridden? Where they are being ridden, are they replacing trips that users would be taking on foot, on a bicycle, on public transportation, or in a car\u2014or are they adding trips that would not be taken at all? Who was not taking these trips? Was prior behavior driven by a tightly constrained household budget? What are T he technological intervention of shared electric scooter (e-scooter) programs into cities, from companies such as Bird, Lyft, and Razor, carries much more than the promise of increased mobility with fewer carbon emissions. New technologies, such as e-scooters, have an uncanny ability to unmask existing gaps\u2014known and unknown\u2014in infrastructure that have long been concealed by conventional expectations and ways of doing things. The challenge is that the newly exposed problems are not always recognized as infrastructure gaps. Instead, they are too often understood to be fundamental problems with the technology itself\u2014or worse, the type of user attracted to that technology. For example, in many cities, a common complaint is that e-scooters are parked improperly and obstruct sidewalks, creating a safety hazard, particularly for those with disabilities [1]. But is it right to blame the user? What if the issue is not lazy users who are bad at parking, but rather the dearth of adequate sidewalk or public space allocated to non-automobile users\u2014especially those who rely on sidewalks as their primary mode of transportation? Even that framing of the problem is troublesome, especially in the U.S. context, where the vast majority of investment continues to favor automobile-oriented infrastructure. The ways in which these new or so-called disruptive technologies impact communities mark them as vectors of change for cities. Ride-hailing services like Lyft, Uber, and Grab have changed how people travel. These shifts paved the way for new modes of food delivery, which in turn have transformed the restaurant industry, leading some popular restaurants to open so-called ghost kitchens to deal with the increased demand. Similarly, a new expectation for rapid delivery has forced cities, ready or not, to think differently about managing curb space to accommodate shifts toward urban freight (in many cases, now delivered in unmarked, personal vehicles). Implicit in the way that these technologies are designed and implemented is the idea of latent demand or unmet needs\u2014that somewhere there\u2019s a granny without a way to get to the doctor, a student in need of pad thai, or a young professional with a primal need for a marmalade cookbook delivered that very same day. From an economic perspective, these new technological forms have let the genie out of the bottle. But it is important not to think about the results of these shifts as inevitable, or even simply as expressions of unmet needs. Instead, new technologies enable novel (re) configurations of cultural arrangements. In turn, these new arrangements open up pathways for future technological development. They may even create needs not yet in anyone\u2019s consciousness. The co-constructed nature of culture and technology is a core tenet of science and technology studies, a field of academic knowledge with longstanding ties to a way of understanding called actor-network theory, or ANT. An influential paper published in the journal Public Understanding of Science laid out a method to use ANT to understand \u201ccontroversies\u201d\u2014a term with special meaning in ANT that indicates a novel sociocultural arrangement that is still in formation.

It was shown that the Ouroboros protocol allows achieving the required security level with significantly shorter confirmation period in comparison with Bitcoin. We estimated minimal number of confirmation blocks and compare estimation time for Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros protocols. As a measure of comparison, we considered transaction confirmation time for which the probability of a double-spend attack is less than 0.1%. We use different standard probability distribution and different properties of Markov chains and Random Walks to get comparison of estimated security properties of Bitcoin blockchain against three different models of Bitcoin double spend attack. The splitting attack based on the model where resources of honest participants are divided to compete different chains is applied to Bitcoin and GHOST consensus protocols. Properties of Markov chains and Random Walks are also applied to obtain security estimations for the Ouroboros protocol. Results. We developed methods to get specific numbers for average block confirmation time for Ouroboros protocol. We compared minimal number of confirmation blocks needed to ensure a high security for considered protocols: Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros. Conclusions. The obtained results allow determination of security bounds for the Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros consensus protocols.

However, controversies emerged with the feverish search for them, and a few papers have been withdrawn or retracted, such as research on chloroquine=hydroxychloroquine,1\u20133 vitamin D,4 lopinavir= ritonavir,5 and favipiravir.6 In several vaccine clinical trials, solicited adverse events that occurred in some volunteers included fatigue, headache, chills, and muscle ache. Hence, several vaccine trials have now been halted.7\u20139 The conflicting results and the crisis of confidence resulted from article retractions and side effects after vaccination may interfere with the doctors\u2019 medical decision-making, intensify the anxiety over the disease among the general public, and even lead to arbitrary drug use. In this case, the effects of drugs and vaccines need to be adequately clarified with more responsible attitudes. Dinis-Oliveira (2020) has pointed out that all players involved must attend specific educational programs and that a \u201cNational Agency for Scientific and Academic Integrity\u201d should be created during the COVID-19 pandemic.10 In the meantime, we would like to propose several feasible suggestions for researchers and journals. Although the rapid spread of COVID-19 has altered the traditional publication procedure of papers, researchers must abide by the principles of scientific research unswervingly. First of all, they need to avoid \u201cpolitical interference\u201d. The conclusion of their research should be based on the real, objective, and verified data rather than the specific point of view or hypothesis. Meanwhile, exaggerating the study results for the sole purpose of publication or sensation should never be advocated. Second, scientists should conduct randomized double-blind controlled studies with large sample sizes, as before. Moreover, the potential damage to other organs or whether there will be any sequelae after the treatment needs to be considered when evaluating the efficacy of the drug or vaccine. Third, unprecedented attention should be paid to the communication and cooperation among those who are studying the same drug regimen. In addition, it is not appropriate to announce the results to the news media before the paper is finally accepted. As for the journals, considering the difficulty in organizing massive duplicate tests or recruiting editors who are adept at analyzing data, we would like to propose the following suggestions. (1) The manuscripts on COVID-19 should be reviewed more strictly. Authors need to provide more detailed information such as data source and collection process. (2) In order to improve the detection efficiency and accuracy of the manuscripts, journals could consider sending them to a company using artificial intelligence for testing. (3) When reviewing COVID-19 papers, the number of peer reviewers could be appropriately increased, and at least one data analyst should be invited to examine the validity of the data in experiments. In the meanwhile, editors should avoid choosing reviewers suggested by authors to make peer review more objective and rigorous. (4) Replication studies and null results of drugs or vaccines on COVID-19 are also meaningful. Therefore, journals should keep a neutral attitude towards them for publication. (5) If the subject of the article is a drug or vaccine that has been seriously controversial, the journal could ask for the authors\u2019 permission and then release it in advance, accept the review by scientists worldwide, and note that \u201cthe article has not been accepted and the conclusion is yet to be reviewed.\u201d", "authors": ["Fei Chen", "Shuai Gong", "Run-Qian Li"], "citations": 0, "venue": "Journal of epidemiology", "year": 2020}, "3": {"title": "Covid-19: Pharma companies promise not to bow to political pressure to rush vaccine production", "abstract": "The chief executive officers (CEOs) of nine drug companies working towards a covid-19 vaccine have issued a joint statement promising to \u201conly submit [a vaccine] for approval or emergency use authorisation after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe pledge to always make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority,\u201d wrote the CEOs of AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer, and Sanofi on 8 September in a statement entitled Biopharma Leaders Stand With Science .1\n\nThe statement follows an open letter by seven drug industry CEOs last week urging that \u201cpolitical considerations should be put aside\u201d in covid-19 drug and vaccine development and that clinical data should be \u2026", "authors": ["O.

Displaced from jobs that had offered decent pay and a modicum of self-respect and unheard by mainstream politicians, the argument ran, working-class voters turned to Trump in the vain hope that he would restore their economic fortunes. The diagnosis was compelling, but it soon ran aground on new analyses of Trump\u2019s electoral base. The people who voted for Trump were white, yes, but many were middle-class. What they had lost, in this alternative diagnosis, was not their economic security but their unquestioned racial supremacy. That Rory McVeigh and Kevin Estep compare the rise of Trump to that of the Ku Klux Klan might lead one to think that they side with the second view. But in fact, their argument is closer to the first. The point of comparing Trump\u2019s supporters to those who joined the KKK is not to liken them to white-hooded racial terrorists. Rather it is to show how susceptible to nativist appeals are white Americans who have been whipsawed by political and economic change. The Politics of Losing: Trump, the Klan, and the Mainstreaming of Resentment is a fascinating read, combining deep knowledge of the history of the Klan with a careful postmortem of primary votes for Trump. Its analysis is evenhanded and sophisticated. I will take issue with the authors\u2019 conclusion about what animated Trump voters, but more important, I want to push further down a path the authors themselves take, asking about the ways in which Americans\u2019 selfinterest is shaped by the communities in which they live. However, I want to press for a more expansive understanding of communities\u2019 influence than the authors allow. The white nationalism we see today is nothing new, McVeigh and Estep make clear. In the early 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had between two and five million dues-paying members: one in every 23 Americans. In the county surrounding the Lynds\u2019 Middletown\u2014Muncie, Indiana\u2014fully a quarter of the adult population were members of the Klan. There were chapters in every state, with especially strong representation in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. This was not your Reconstruction-era Klan. When Methodist preacher William Simmons set out to revive the organization in 1915, he was largely unsuccessful until he paid recruiters $4 of every $10 membership fee they collected and sent them around the country to identify the resentments of white Protestant Americans. Those resentments, it became clear, had everything to do with the emerging industrial economy and the flood of unskilled laborers\u2014women, African Americans who had left the South, and immigrants\u2014who were filling jobs in new factories at the same time as they were gaining new access to politics. Those left behind were small producers and skilled laborers. It was easy for the new Klan to pin these Americans\u2019 woes on immigrants, Catholics, Jews, and union organizers, and Klan organizers did just that. The strategy worked, and membership soared.

The development version uses the search engine which is exposed to loads of search queries with suboptimal length. The aim of the research is to minimise the number of queries and keep the detection sensitivity on the same level. The paper presents a few methods of determining the number of search engine results for given query. The aim is to estimate the optimal phrase to be send to the search engine. Estimations were confirmed by neural network; after that a statistical model was created and tested. The model is fitted with data extracted from massively processed language corpus, where normalised Google distance for each common bigram is used for creating a query-specific context vector which characteristics was found to be related to the number of result for given query. Introduction Today\u2019s systems for plagiarism detection (hereinafter called as antiplagiators), which use search engines (SE) for online plagiarism detection, deals with problem of determining optimal search query size. The usual technique is based on the process of selecting some phrases from the given document and adding the list of found web address for each query to the result set for next analysis. Potthas (2012) calls different phases of this process as chunking, keyphrase extraction and query formulation. The main problem is how to determine the number of words which should be included to the search query. Usually a static length of a fragment of text is used to create a query (for example in Copyscape checker service). According Nina, Peter and Wilkinson (2007) it has the right query length is strongly correlated to the \u201cbroadness of generality\u201d in the context of query\u2019s meaning. We believe that using a variable length fitted to the meaning (called optimal query length) improves the sensitivity of detection which is discussed here but it\u2019s confirmation is not covered by this paper. The aim of this paper is to present it\u2019s optimisation. When using longer than optimal phrases, only a minor modification of tested plagiarised document can make it undetectable. The advantage is that the detection itself is faster, because the ratio between whole number of query and document size is low. Use of shorter than optimal phrases has two disadvantages\u2014the number of queries is relatively higher and there is strong dependency on search engine algorithms for sorting the results. Low number of words in a search query usually leads to huge numbers of search results, which are inaccessible without more listing queries. The most precise results can be obtained when the phrase size is determined dynamically by querying the SE with increasing length of selected phrase and use the last non-empty result set (Vesel\u00fd, 2013) Vesel\u00fd and Kolomazn\u00edk (2012) call that a naive approach. PAPERS\u2014SECTION IV Predicting number of search engine results . . . Figure 11.2. Creation of datasets of bigrams where the context similarity for each pair of words is stored to retrieve context relevancy vector for an arbitrary query The disadvantage is the huge number of queries to the SE; one query for every tested word. There was an unsuccessful attempt for optimisation based on presumption that \u201cthere is a relation between vector of frequency occurrences of each word in query and the number of results we got from the search\u201d (Vesel\u00fd, Kolomazn\u00edk 2012), but the conclusion was clear \u201cneural network has not reveal any relation between the frequency of occurrence of the word in the query and the number of results of search engine\u201d. Due to the fact that a similar principle is widely used on Google Similarity Distance (Cilibrasi, Vitanyi, 2007) applications, we presume that for successful estimation of SE results is necessary to account the mutual context of the words, not only its frequency occurrence. It leads to the necessity of massive pre-procession of language corpus to get a similarity index for each common pair (bigram) of words. This article is to verify the hypothesis that the set of these indexes is the key for determining the number of search results to optimise plagiarism detection. Methods There is a brief list of steps we followed to conduct the experiment: 1. creation of two large datasets of bigrams where the context similarity for each pair of words is calculated and stored, 2. implementation an bigrams database for determination of context relevancy vector for an arbitrary query, 3. use of neural network and statistical regression to interpret the context relevancy vector so the estimation of number the SE results can be calculated for related query, 4. testing the accuracy of estimation with the SE data. The first two steps are represented by following schematic. Two different datasets were created because two difference functions were needed. One for estimating the number of SE results by quoted queries (which means that the query represents the exact phrase we are looking for; it\u2019s also called phrase search) and another dataset for unquoted queries. Ond\u0159ej Vesel\u00fd, Jan Kolomazn\u00edk PAPERS\u2014SECTION IV Table 1 Two sets of interval used for context vector normalisation Class No quotes intervals \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + Quotes intervals \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + The Czech National Corpus (SYN2010) was used for estimating the number of results for phrase searches. All pairs of adjacent words from the corpus were added to the dataset; if the pair was already in the set, the related counter was increased. This resulted in a gigabyte file where a pairs of words were associated with the value of the occurrence counter (see table bigrams database on fig. 1) We did not have direct access to the corpus which we needed in order to create the next dataset for the unquoted corpus, so an alternative corpus (Majli\u0161, 2012) was used. In this case we indexed all words in each corpus fragment, not only the adjacent ones, in order to reflect the SE behaviour. This led to the exponential increase of time and space complexity; the procession itself takes four weeks on a common computer in spite of the fact that we ignored stop words and words shorter than 5 characters. Also a really simple lemmatization was used: the last two characters of the words were removed to suspend the morphology difference for the words with the same meaning. As we considered this as a prototype, we analysed only about one third of the corpus. Implementing comprehensive solutions like MapReduce would definitely improve the actually reached prediction level. As described in steps 1 and 2 we constructed a system which could provide a context relevancy vector, which is believed to be related with the number of results, we need to find and formulate the relation. For confirmation of existence of the relation, the two layer neural network with backpropagation learning was used. Step 3. is fulfilled by experiments described in the next sections. Two query datasets were used: quoted (Qq) and unquoted (Qw) queries together with the number of hits given by SE. Creating and normalising the context vector As it is showed in fig 1, the context vector is a simple set of context values from bigrams database for (almost) every pair of words in query. The short words are ignored. This fact results to variable length of the context vector exponentially related to the query length. The process of vector normalisation was based on classifying each number in given vector to the intervals in table 1. The resulting normalised vector was constructed from number of occurrences of each class. Table 1 shows the chosen distribution of intervals mapped to the position in the context vector. For example, normalised context vector from fig 1 is (1, 1, 0, 2, 2). PAPERS\u2014SECTION IV Predicting number of search engine results . . . Table 2 Mean square error (MSE) value determined by neural network on different datasets by number of words in query by context vector Qq dataset . . Qw dataset . . Experiment 1, confirmation of the relation Let Qw be the unquoted query and Qq the quoted query. Let SE(Q) be a number of result of the SE for a given Q and CV(Q) the context vector of Q. We will try to fit a model NN(CV(Q)) which could confirm the following relation: NN(CV(Q)) \u223c log (SE(Q)) In the other words, we want to provide functionality to estimate the magnitude of SE results for a given Q. The following table compares resulting mean square errors when predicting log (SE(Q)) from two query datasets (made by Qw and Qq types) both populated by two different calculations which were used as training data. The first calculation was based on the number of words in the query (as a method described in SYN2010). The second calculations consist of described context vector given a token from bigrams database. The context vector was normalised as described before. Table 2 shows that with a context vector there is a noticeably lower MSE in both datasets. This means that calculation of the context vector contains the information which could be used to improve the number of SE hits in comparison to the simple estimation with a query word count. The learned neural network is good enough for operational use, but the disadvantage of a neural network is it\u2019s black box like behaviour\u2014we could not understand the relation deeply enough to satisfy the academic purpose. Only two layers of the neural network gave us a rational reason to speculate that the relation is simple enough to be described by a statistical model, so we made another experiment. Experiment 2, finding the relation by creating statistical model We expected, that relationship can be formally expressed by mathematical formula in order to have a tool to calculate log (SE(Q)) from CV(Q). To reveal the relation formula (one coefficient for each member of CV(Q)), we replaced neural network NN, by statistical linear model LM. LM(CV(Q)) \u223c log (SE(Q)) The data from Experiment 1 was used for fitting LM implemented in R-project like lm function. The model determined the rela", "authors": ["O. Vesel\u00fd", "J.

To address this gap, the article follows the \u201caesthetic turn\u201d in IR to examine gardens as contingent social constructions of social-ordering and world-ordering which both shape and participate in global politics.

Draft copy: please don\u2019t quote without permission 2 On December 26, 2013, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo to commemorate his country\u2019s war dead. A few days later Liu Xiaoming (2014), China\u2019s ambassador to the United Kingdom, denounced Abe\u2019s visit in London\u2019s Daily Telegraph: In the Harry Potter story, the dark wizard Voldemort dies hard because the seven horcruxes, which contain parts of his soul, have been destroyed. If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation\u2019s soul. Last week, in flagrant disregard of the feelings of his Asian neighbors, Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, paid homage at the Yasukuni Shrine ... Liu here is voicing a reasonable concern that Abe is remilitarizing Japan; indeed, the Yasukuni Shrine is a controversial site because it enshrines the souls of thousands of war criminals. China and South Korea are particularly critical when Japan\u2019s leaders visit the Shrine because they are still mourning the atrocities committed by imperial Japan. Discussions of the Yasukuni Shrine thus characteristically frame it as an issue of \u201cJapanese nationalism,\u201d \u201cEast Asian International Relations (IR),\u201d and/or the problems of \u201chistory and memory\u201d (see Kingston 2007; Takenaka 2015). Ambassador Liu\u2019s intervention is interesting because it points in new directions. Certainly, his invocation of Harry Potter follows the trend in IR that values popular culture as an innovative approach to global politics (see Neumann and Nexon 2006). Importantly for this article, Liu\u2019s criticism of Abe\u2019s visit to the Yasukuni Shine also highlights gardens as sites of global politics: the Shrine is not simply a memorial, it is also a garden park (see Mashima 2008). While \u201cpeace gardens\u201d as a site for relaxation are now common in everyday urban life (see McClimens, Doel, Ibbotson, Partridge, Muscroft and Lockwood 2012), how can we understand the global politics of gardens which actively celebrate war? This article thus follows the Chinese ambassador\u2019s lead to explore how gardens Draft copy: please don\u2019t quote without permission 3 can be \u201cunexpected places\u201d for the global politics of diplomacy, peace and war in a general sense (see Sylvester 2008; Lisle 2016; Guillaume et al. 2015), and how the Yasukuni Shrine in particular demands to be interpreted as a peace/war garden. Although gardens are a popular location for diplomatic performances\u2014 the Treaty of Versailles, for example\u2014analysis of the global politics of gardens itself is under-researched in IR. Serious analysis is generally located in the humanities and professional schools: art history, social history and landscape architecture (see Barm\u00e9 1996, 2008; Clunas 1996; Jay 2011; Kuitert 2012, 2017; Henderson 2013; Wang 2014). Among social scientists, geographers and sociologists have devoted the most attention to the topic, using gardens to interrogate relations of space, nature, culture and power (see Bauman 1987, 1989; Yoon 1994; Mukerji 1997, 2012; Luke 2000; Burrell and Dale 2002; McClimens et al. 2012). This article builds on these interdisciplinary trends, especially as they combine in international social history/international historical sociology (see Go and Lawson 2017). The aim is to examine how gardens\u2014like battlefields (see Guillaume et al. 2015, 2)\u2014are contingent social constructions which shape and participate in global politics. Gardens here are a site, an institution, an enactment, and an encounter. In addition to analyzing gardens as sites of symbolic power, the article also appreciates them as a material modality where diplomacy, war and peace are represented, performed, and experienced through more embodied, affective and everyday encounters (Butler 1990; Enloe 2011; Lisle 2016, 22). The aim of the article, then, is to highlight how peace/war becomes intelligible, and thus is enacted or appropriated, in part through garden performances. To develop a framework for exploring the global politics of gardens, the article first locates its analysis in four interrelated theoretical contexts: Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s \u201cdistribution of the sensible,\u201d Foucault\u2019s \u201cheterotopia,\u201d and the hybrid concept \u201ccivility/martiality,\u201d in order to understand gardens as a dynamic performance of cultural governance and resistance. The following two sections use examples from Japan, China and France to further develop this analytical framework, which is then applied to explore how two key national memorial spaces\u2014the Draft copy: please don\u2019t quote without permission 4 Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo and the Nanjing Massacre Memorial in China\u2014act as gardens which embody different experiences of cultural governance and resistance. The conclusion argues that we can use this analytical framework to raise questions about other key national memorial spaces, such as the National September 11 Museum and Memorial in New York. The analysis thus advances critical IR in two ways: it uses gardens to explore how global politics emerge through complex performances of social-ordering and world-ordering, and it employs non-Western (here East Asian) concepts and examples to explore global politics both beyond and within Euro-America. Aesthetic Global Politics The discussion of the global politics of gardens is located in the \u201caesthetic turn\u201d of international studies (see Bleiker 2009; Shapiro 2013). It argues that the issues of diplomacy, war and peace can be profitably explored through an assemblage of conceptual dynamics: utopia/dystopia/heterotopia, (re)distribution of the sensible, cultural governance/resistance and civil/military. It is common to see gardens as a utopian space: a peaceful place, a blissful island of apolitical serenity, where people engage in contemplation, play, and sensuous enjoyment. In both Persian and Greek, \u201cParadise\u201d comes from the word for a walled garden (Burrell and Dale 2002; McClimens et al. 2012,124125, Henderson 2013, xi, 6). Interestingly, in his discussion of utopia and heterotopia, Foucault points directly to gardens. Utopian spaces, according to Foucault (1986, 24), are \u201cfundamentally unreal spaces ... sites with no real place.\u201d Heterotopia, however, can be radical because it is \u201ccapable of juxtaposing in a single real place several spaces, several sites that are in themselves incompatible\u201d (Foucault 1986, 25). Heterotopia is a hybrid place where multiple spaces are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted. Foucault\u2019s examples of heterotopia are colonies, brothels, prisons, cemeteries, ships\u2014and gardens. Here, heterotopia is involved in projects of social-ordering and world-ordering. Indeed, Foucault (1986, 26) is particularly fascinated by the garden as heterotopia because it \u201cis the smallest parcel of the world and then it Draft copy: please don\u2019t quote without permission 5 is the totality of the world. ... [it is] a sort of happy, universalizing heterotopia.\u201d Botanical gardens, for example, are a heterotopic mix of incompatible plants which juxtapose incommensurable ecosytems: alpine plants in lowland London, and desert plants in rain-forest Singapore (see Luke 2000). Heterotopia, then, is an interesting concept because it liberates us from the search for singular meaning, and encourages us to understand space aesthetically in terms of multiple, overlapping and contingent dynamics, such as utopia/dystopia/heterotopia (see Ranci\u00e8re 2004, 40-41). When we speak of \u201caesthetics\u201d in global politics, we are not discussing a theory of beauty, but are more concerned with styles of ordering that raise ethical questions (Hall and Ames 1998; Ranci\u00e8re 2004, 2009; Bleiker 2009; Shapiro 2013). Ranci\u00e8re (2004,10) argues that we need to understand aesthetics as a \u201cspecific regime for identifying and reflecting on the arts: a mode of articulation between ways of doing and making, their corresponding forms of visibility, and possible ways of thinking about their relationships.\u201d Aesthetics is thus a specific \u201cdistribution of the sensible\u201d: \u201cthe delimitation of spaces and times, of the visible and the invisible, of speech and noise, that simultaneously determines the place and the stakes of politics as a form of experience\u201d (Ranci\u00e8re 2004, 13). Politics, then, is not found in the struggle for power, but in the configuration of space that frames social-ordering and world-ordering. Politics thus takes shape either in \u201cpolicing\u201d the hegemonic distribution of the sensible, or challenging it through dissensus, a redistribution of the sensible that \u201cdisrupt[s] the relationship bet", "authors": ["William", "A.", "Callahan"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2018}, "2": {"title": "A Systematic Literature Review of Misconceptions in Linear Circuit Analysis", "abstract": "Misconceptions in circuit analysis have been investigated by many researchers.

We also created a conceptual dependency graph to help point out foundational misconceptions within the misconception categories, yielding Physics, Math, and Application of Ohm's Law as the most foundational misconceptions. Physics had 5 misconceptions (the most) and in total cited by 7 articles. Within Physics, the most cited was term confusion, cited by 4 articles. Math had 2 misconceptions, cited by 3 articles. Application of Ohm's Law had 2 misconceptions, cited by 7 articles. Interestingly, none of the articles attempted to address misconceptions. Thus, there appears to be a need for research that addresses misconceptions. We might suggest focusing on prevalently reported misconceptions, such as physics term confusion and appropriate application of Ohm's Law. Introduction Misconceptions in circuit analysis have been investigated by many researchers, and researchers have identified numerous issues: Conceptual [1][2][3][4], term confusion [5][6], fundamental mathematical skills [7][8], incomplete metaphor [9][10], and diagnostics to identify such misconceptions [5][11]. Further, researchers have investigated many aspects: Community college through research university levels, laboratory and lecture settings, and across different learning materials. However, there does not appear to have been a systematic literature review of this work in over 20 years. Thus, we undertook a literature search to provide a more updated systematic review of misconception research. Misconceptions are important to identify and address because such misconceptions may follow the student into subsequent courses. Thus, focusing on linear circuit analysis is important because linear circuit analysis is a foundational course in electrical engineering. The concepts learned in linear circuit analysis, such as Ohm\u2019s Law, source transformations, and basic calculations for solving for voltage, resistance, and current in circuit components, are built upon in later courses, such as digital system design and semiconductor devices. Thus, misconceptions found in linear circuit analysis may persist. Such misconceptions can arise from various sources, such as textbooks [10][12], previous courses, classroom lectures, or laboratory experiences [13]. In this paper, we systematically reviewed the literature on circuit analysis misconceptions. We analyzed the literature by analyzing the research methodologies, categorizing the misconceptions, enumerating the types of research, and building a conceptual dependency graph. Methods The goal of our literature search was to identify research conducted in the past 20 years that was relevant to misconceptions in circuit analysis engineering courses, typically taken by students in their first year. To that end, the search was conducted in Google Scholar [14] using the search: misconceptions \"circuit analysis\" \"electrical engineering\" \"first-year\" -electrochemistry The notation means: Each search term is either a single word or combined words (inside double-quotes). Combined words must be found together and as written. The search terms are combined using an AND Boolean operation. A NOT operation was applied to \"electrochemistry\". To identify the topic of linear circuit analysis, the broader term \u201ccircuit analysis\u201d was included, as specifying \u201clinear circuit analysis\u201d narrowed the results to 6 papers and eliminated relevant articles. The term \u201celectrical engineering\u201d was included to pinpoint research done within engineering courses. Because circuit analysis is done across multiple courses, the term \u201cfirst-year\u201d was included to identify papers relevant to the topics taught in the beginning foundational circuit analysis courses. \"First-year\" in many papers refers to the first year of learning the major-specific topics. Many articles were specific to electrochemistry, so -\u200belectrochemistry\u200b was included to eliminate electrochemistry articles. We included peer-reviewed articles and dissertations between the years 1997 to 2018. Our main inclusion criteria required articles to specifically discuss misconceptions relevant to topics taught in basic circuit analysis engineering courses (e.g. articles discussing more advanced engineering courses, such as electromagnetism, were discounted). For each article, the following data was extracted: The location of where the research was conducted, the number of participants in the study, the type of study conducted, and every misconception identified. We noticed often several papers would refer to the same misconception but using different terminology, so we selected the most succinct term that well-described the misconception. Literature review results A total of 93 articles were found from this search. 72 were found to be irrelevant to our topic. 6 articles were unable to be accessed. Thus, 15 articles met the inclusion criteria. This section briefly describes each article. Several researchers relied on validated assessments to develop their diagnostic test. Some tests included questions from combination of validated assessments. Hussain picked 12 questions specific to Thevenin and Norton equivalents [15] from assessments developed by Engelhardt (DIRECT) [5] and Sabah [16]. Other tests used a subset of questions from only one validated assessment. For example, Underwood [17] used a selection of questions from the Circuits Concept Inventory (CCI) [11] for a diagnostic test. Some researchers developed their own in-house assessments [18][19][20]. Smaill developed an in-house assessment based on previous work [5][21][22], which included 20 multiple choice and 2 free response questions. Students had 30 minutes to complete the questions [18][19][20]. Smaill administered the assessment to three groups of students: 560 students in 2007 [19], 543 students in 2008 [18], and over 1600 students from 2007 to 2009 [20]. Participants consisted of students from New Zealand and the United States. Other researchers developed in-house assessments based on their classroom and laboratory experiences, sampling questions from class quizzes and exams [9][23]. After informally studying student responses in lectures and and recitation lessons, Kautz developed diagnostic questions optional for students to complete during class lectures, or at the end of their final exam. Another popular method for observing misconceptions in circuit analysis courses was through student interviews, typically done after the diagnostic test. Biswas identified specific misconceptions students had about AC circuits through a series of interviews with a total of 18 students, who gave walk-through explanations of their circuit analysis steps [9]. Finally, one paper analyzed learning materials to identify potential misconceptions in explanations of concepts. Sangam and Jesiek analyzed circuit analysis concepts and links between the concepts to pinpoint misconceptions common across 5 textbooks [10]. A suggest for future research is to combine a validated assessment, such as DIRECT [5], with an interview to help dive deeper into the misconception. A validated assessment has already been verified to have questions that accurately predict conceptual understanding across a large population. An interview enable a researcher to better explore why the misconception exists. Interestingly, none of the articles attempted to address the misconceptions, so there exists a need for addressing misconceptions experimentally. Analysis of Misconception Categories Many of the misconception topics found shared commonalities in the overall concept being taught, or the type of circuit being analyzed. Thus, we grouped the misconceptions into the following 8 misconception categories: \u25cf Physics: 5 misconceptions pertaining to the fundamentals of physics. Ex: Charge as a property of matter. \u25cf Math: 2 misconceptions pertaining to the use of math in circuit analysis. Ex: Algebraic manipulations. \u25cf Sequential reasoning: 1 misconception pertaining to the failure to consider effects on the circuit as a whole during analysis. Ex: \u200bGeneral failure to consider local changes in context of entire circuit. \u25cf Application of Ohm\u2019s Law: 2 misconceptions pertaining to the understanding and application of Ohm\u2019s Law. Ex: Inappropriate application or blind reliance of Ohm's Law. \u25cf Elements in series and parallel: 2 misconceptions pertaining to identifying and analyzing circuit elements in series and parallel. Ex: Misidentifying if components are in series or in parallel. \u25cf Open and short circuits: 4 misconceptions pertaining to analyzing effects in a circuit when circuits are open or shorted. Ex: Recognizing voltage effects in open and closed circuits. \u25cf Kirchoff\u2019s circuit laws: 2 misconceptions pertaining to the application of Kirchoff\u2019s Current Law and Kirchoff\u2019s Voltage Law. Ex: Belief the direction of mesh currents matter in mesh analysis. \u25cf AC circuits: 2 misconceptions pertaining to analyzing AC circuits. Ex: Identifying what is alternating in an AC circuit. Table 1 includes each specific misconception organized by misconception categories. Each specific misconception is briefly described. For example, in physics, a misconception is related to charge as a property of matter. Specifically, some students thought that electrons carry positive charge [7", "authors": ["Nikitha Sambamurthy", "Alex D.

This research is focused on finding biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, staging, treatment response and targets for chemotherapy, generating a panel of markers which provide better clinical information compared to a single marker in the panel.

Cognizant of the power of gonadotropin preparations that evolved from natural sources, to the next generation of recombinant proteins, more, bigger follicles were excavated in search of the precious pearl: an oocyte capable of producing a term gestation following IVF or ICSI. Suspicions have been raised repeatedly as to the impact of COS on the overall yield of high quality oocytes that would be needed to generate high quality embryos\u2014that is those capable of making a baby. Are such oocytes, physiologically destined to the dead end known as atresia, capable of being rejuvenated and repurposed into a fate consonant with the rules of pregnancy? And what effect, if any, would the pharmacological acceleration of follicular development have on the apparently methodical pace of procrastination that the oocyte takes during its journey through the final stages of oogenesis? Unfortunately, as reported in the paper by Reichman et al in this issue, up to 30% of these fail to complete the run to \u201cmeiotic \u201cmaturity required to get onto the embryo bandwagon in concert with the daily operations of an ART facility. \n \nThis population of oocytes, laggards as it were, deserves such a classification because at the time of retrieval such oocytes exist in either germinal vesicle or meiosis I stages. Historically, these immature oocytes have assumed a special importance for patients unfortunate enough to have yielded few mature oocytes after COS. Indeed, some patients may yield only immature oocytes! For them, a second opportunity to achieve maturity would increase the chances of having embryo transfer and a pregnancy. This has been one of the hopeful dimensions of human ARTs, based on the prospect of allowing these laggards to catch up with their mature sisterhood after prolonged culture. \u201cBetter late than never at all\u201d designates this form of human oocyte IVM. \n \nWhat to do, then, with these immature oocytes obtained after COH? This is an especially valid question when posed in the context of human oocyte research. Could this material serve to fill the void we now have for optimizing techniques such as oocyte cryopreservation and IVM? Until now there has been little doubt that such oocytes do \u201cmature\u201d after prolonged culture, but the likelihood that these oocytes would exhibit some of the initial qualities that are expected to follow IVF or ICSI has not been fully determined. What the study by Reichman and associates now alerts us to is in some ways predictive of the \u201cdark side\u201d of COS, but in other ways raises awareness as to the lack of fundamental knowledge we now have concerning the biology of the human oocyte. To quote Christopher Marlowe, \u201cthere is no sin but ignorance.\u201d \n \nReichman and colleagues undertook an analysis of 234 in vivo matured human oocytes and compared their post-ICSI developmental performance to 263 matched oocytes that were evaluated following a 24-hour period of in vitro maturation. As in previous studies, oocytes used for IVM were distinguished from their in vivo-matured counterparts in several critical ways. First, these oocytes clearly were retrieved from follicles that did not support their maturation after COS (six different protocols were tracked) as they were arrested in either the GV or M1 stages of meiosis. Second, staging for meiotic status and access for subsequent ICSI requires removal of any adherent cumulus cells, meaning that whatever degree of maturation these oocytes could achieve in vitro was done in the absence of supportive somatic cells. Finally, the medium employed for IVM was supplemented with recombinant FSH and LH (75mIU/mL each), as recommended by the commercial providers, and created a remarkably different microenvironment from that experienced by oocytes that matured within the follicle prior to their retrieval. Given this, the question has been can oocytes matured under these conditions produce developmentally competent zygotes after ICSI? The answer: No. \n \nTracking these oocytes with respect to their degree of maturation in vitro revealed that, in fact, only 48% were able to reach M2, and the vast majority of these were derived from oocytes that were already at M1 when subjected to culture. Notably, of the GV-stage oocytes placed in culture, only 35% matured to M2 (compare to 78% if IVM was initiated at M1 stage). The first and hardly surprising message is that, given the heterogeneous follicular source of these oocytes, nearly half were not only unable to initiate maturation in vivo, but they were also unable to do so in vitro. By comparison, if maturation was initiated in vivo, there was a greater likelihood of completing this process when subsequently cultured. \n \nMore telling and critical to the clinical utility of these oocytes was the assessment of their developmental progression analyzed in day 2 embryos produced by ICSI. For all three parameters reflecting embryo quality that were evaluated (cleavage rate, fragmentation, blastomere symmetry), clear evidence for developmental delays and aberrations was noted for the IVM oocytes, relative to their sibling IVO oocytes. The fact that no pregnancies were obtained after transfer reinforces this baseline data in documenting fundamental disturbances in cell-cycle timing and progression that were likely to have been compounded by severe aneuploidies and mosaics, had these embryos been subjected to PGS. \n \nThere are two important lessons this study underlines: One, with the drive to optimize IVM for human oocytes as an efficient and safe ART, the use of such \u201cspare\u201d oocytes for research applications in this area is both superfluous and likely to be very misleading. This fact emphasizes that future research must rely upon intact COCs subjected to pharmacological inhibitors, so as to harness the synchrony of cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation in the context of somatic cell support with appropriate human materials and/or animal models. Two, the clinical utility of this material is abysmal and, given that the characteristics shown by these embryos, is sentinel for major genetic alterations. One wonders, then, whether a conservative and clear statement should be made to limit transfer of such embryos to truly exceptional cases. \n \nStay tuned as we continue to cover the evolution of ARTs in the context of contemporary science.", "authors": ["D.

Sir Spencer Wells took exception to the principles of this classification. lie urged that the operation might be advised in some cases of uterine fibroids, ;Ind in uncontrollable uterine haemorrhagte, and in certain malformations of the genitals, deformities of the pelvis, and accidental obstruction of the vagina. lie further urged that in enses. of ovarian tlysmenorrh(ea or neuralgia the right to remove the ovaries wats -ery limited, and only existed wheen those affections had resisted all treatmient, life or reason being endangered. He denied that the operation was inadmissible in nearly all cases of nervous excitement, and that it should never be done without the consent of a sane patient, to whom the consequences of the operation had been explained. Sir Spencer Wells insisted that the excision of morbid appendages or ovaries should be distinguished from oophorectomy, and ought never to be done without the authority of a consultation; and that in nymphomania and mental disease it was at least unjustifiable. MIr. Lawson Tait attached more importance to the removal of the tubes. Ile generally, but not always, removed the ovaries as well when he cut away diseased tubes, terming that procedure\" removal of the appendages,\" now commonly spoken of as \"Tait's operation.\" He considered the proper field for the removal of healthy ovaries to be very limited. Mr. Hatherly referred the ethical points above noted to the general sen8e, not of specialists alone, but to the whole profession. Ile could see no reasoni whly a diseased ovary or tube should be held more sacred than any other diseased organ, but insisted on consultations and an explanation of the nature and effects of the operation in quiestion to the patient. Ile regretted that after-histories of cases of the removal of healthy ovaries were not carefully recorded. Recovery from the operation was too often the last chapter in the history of the case. Clinical evidence, however, favoured extirpation of healthy ovaries in cases of bleeding uterine flbroids. Speaking of the removal of the appendages in ovarian or menstrual epilepsy or mania, Mr. Iatherly maintained that suich an operation should never be undertaRen in the case of a lunatic whose disease was not seriously aggravated during the menstrual periods. In order to establish beyond reasonable doubt the dependence of the mental disease on the uterine functions, an expert in lunacy should always be consulted, in addition to any other consultation which may have been held, and no operation sh1ould be undertaken withouit the approval of that expert. That lunatics or epileptics should become wives or mothers was very undesirable, and the preservation of their procreative powers was of less importance than in the case of the sane; on the other hand, their very helplessness was a strong claim for increased precauition. We should be thoroughly satisfied that their condition might be improved by such means, and by such means alone. The written consent of the legal guardian should be a necessary preliminarto Blattey's or other like operation on a lunatic.

Mr. Tait's treatmnent of cases of pelvic suppuration by opening the peritoineal cavity, washing it out and draig, had in many instances been followed by the happiest results. Any surgeon who had to deal with a case of intestinal obstruction, if all other methods failed and life were seriously endangered, would not hesitate to perform abdominal section, which would be attended by ver little greater risk than an operation for strangulated hernia. Diagnosis of the exact site of the obstruction was the main difficuilty.

Hlatherly had tapped a patient on five different occasions, and at gradually decreasing intervals, for ascites which he believed to be tubercular. After each tapping there remained a substance in the left ovarian region which appeared to increase. Althlough he anticipated that it was onlv a mass of tubercle, he deterniined on the next occasion when paracentesis appeared necessary to make a small exploratory incision instead, wide enough to admit the forefinger. Tlhis course enabled him to exclude all probability of wrong diagnosis. The patient was very little distressed by the operation, and left the hospital on the eighth day. Now, altlhough the abdomen was again filled with fluid, thej distension was not increasing so rapidly as before, and a longer interval than usual between previous tappings had already elapsed. Mr. Hlatherly quoted a case under Sir Spencer Wells where the peritoneum was found to be studded with mvrinds of tubercles, yet the patient got well and married. An exploratory incision was scarcely more dangerouts tlhan tlhe insertion of a trocar, and when there was uncertainty as to the caise of ascites, there was no valid objection to abdominal section.

Althlough he anticipated that it was onlv a mass of tubercle, he deterniined on the next occasion when paracentesis appeared necessary to make a small exploratory incision instead, wide enough to admit the forefinger. Tlhis course enabled him to exclude all probability of wrong diagnosis. The patient was very little distressed by the operation, and left the hospital on the eighth day. Now, altlhough the abdomen was again filled with fluid, thej distension was not increasing so rapidly as before, and a longer interval than usual between previous tappings had already elapsed. Mr. Hlatherly quoted a case under Sir Spencer Wells where the peritoneum was found to be studded with mvrinds of tubercles, yet the patient got well and married. An exploratory incision was scarcely more dangerouts tlhan tlhe insertion of a trocar, and when there was uncertainty as to the caise of ascites, there was no valid objection to abdominal section.

Eugene, OR: Cascade Books, 2009. Pp. viii + 238. Paper, $ 28.00", "abstract": "Richard Freund has written a magnificent volume that combines studies of biblical texts, rabbinic traditions, archaeology, and geography into a discussion on some of the most controversial topics in biblical and ancient Near Eastern studies. Specifically, the book begins with an introductory chapter where Freund explains his approach and defines concepts. For example, his definition of \u201cBible\u201d includes Jewish, Christian, and Islamic literature (pp. 5\u20136). He discusses critical approaches to the Scriptures, gives a basic overview of biblical history, and introduces the reader to what archaeology can and cannot do. In the book\u2019s Appendix, he discusses what one can expect if one wishes to participate in an archaeological excavation. The heart of the book contains eight chapters, with each chapter devoted to a controversial topic. He begins with perhaps the biggest controversy of all in chapter 1\u2014the historicity of the Exodus and the search for Mt. Sinai. He follows that with a discussion of the search for David and Solomon\u2019s Jerusalem in chapter 2. He describes the difficulty of finding evidence for a historical David and Solomon and the difficulties of excavating in Jerusalem. He then searches for Jesus in Galilee and Babylon in chapter 3, where he discusses the difficulty of finding evidence for a single person, even a famous one. Freund looks for women in ancient Israel in chapter 4. Other than Jephthah\u2019s daughter, these women have minimal association with the Christian Bible. He writes about Livia Julia, Berenice, Babatha and Beruriah (the last two are from Rabbinic traditions). However, his discussion on the difficulties of finding evidence of the lives of women (and men) through archaeology is very enlightening. Freund searches for evidence of an incense burning ritual in the synagogue in chapter 5. He turns his attention toward the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Qumran community in chapter 6. Although the \u201cTeacher of Righteousness\u201d is in the title of the chapter, the chapter focuses mostly on the Qumran site itself, particularly the cemetery. His discussion in this chapter gives a good overview of Qumran studies and the difficulties associated with it. In chapter 7, Freund searches for Mary the mother of Jesus. This chapter focuses on his excavation of Mary\u2019s well (and associated bathhouse) in Nazareth. The final chapter is dedicated to the search for the historical Bar Kokhba of the early second century ce Jewish revolt. Freund, a Jewish Rabbi, a professor of Jewish history, and a Near Eastern archaeologist, writes from a personal perspective in a story-telling manner. His chapters include anecdotal material and side stories from his years of excavation experience and from his broad studies in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic history. This makes the book easy to read and it keeps one\u2019s interest. Perhaps this is the best element of the book. His personal way of writing in the first person and telling snippets from his experience makes reading the book seem like Freund is sitting in the room telling the story. The only shortcoming in the book is the lack of source documentation. Freund does include in text documentation when he quotes a source, like citing Jacob Neusner on page 156, but does not include footnotes to reference his sources that he does not cite directly. In short, the reader will have difficultly following the researching of much of his material. He does include an extensive bibliography in the back of the book. In conclusion, Freund uses his vast knowledge and experience of two fields of study\u2014textual critical biblical studies and archaeology\u2014and joins them in a way that scholars have rarely joined them in the last few decades in order to understand ancient events and people. I think people who are interested in biblical controversies and archaeology, whether a novice or expert, will find the book to be an interesting read. Terry W.

This paper describes authors\u2019 experiences in teaching the fundamentals of World Wide Web search engines and the Internet technology to non-major undergraduate students. In one course, the first author taught a foundation seminar on the subject of web search engines to a group of first-year students from various disciplines from social sciences, humanity, natural sciences, and engineering. In the second course, the second author taught an upper level course on the subject of wireless and personal communications to non-majors from the business school. Both courses gave us rich experiences on how to reach non-major undergraduate students with topics of great importance and great interest. World Wide Web and the Internet have touched our life in many aspects. From a technology point of view, both the Web and the Internet have been experiencing dramatic changes since the inception of the Internet in the late 60s and early 70s and the Web in the 90s. The technology of the Internet and the Web evolved from the ones used national laboratories for exclusive research projects with expensive equipment in the early days to what ordinary people today use for their daily life on devices such as cell phones and other consumer-oriented, small mobile devices. More and more people use the Web and the Internet everyday and more are curious about how the Web and Internet work. From a societal impact point of view, the Web and the Internet have become an essential tool in our live, similar to reading and writing, having reached a level where we have to study carefully the effect of this tool on our learning and on our live. Traditionally, the subject of communications network and Web is taught in the context of science and technology, typically in a junior or senior course offered for majors in computer science, computer science and engineering, information technology, and other similar majors. These courses teach students the scientific principles and engineering technology involved in the design, implementation, testing, maintaining, and applications of the communications network and the Web. The students taking these courses typically have substantial computer science background such as programming, algorithms, data structures, operating systems, as well as proper mathematics background at or beyond calculus. In short, these courses were not accessible for students outside the aforementioned specialized majors. With the fast development and successful commercialization of technology such as mobile phone and e-commerce, the Internet and Web technology has reached ordinary people who do not have sophisticated technical background. The interest is growing fast of knowing how these basic technology work and how they may affect our live. How can we effectively teach the relevant technology and its societal impact to college students who have no technology background, or otherwise no interest P ge 22407.2 in the technology detail itself? It is in this context that the two authors would like to share with the community their experiences of teaching such courses. This paper describes authors\u2019 experiences in teaching the fundamentals of World Wide Web search engines and the communications network technology to non-major undergraduate students. By non-majors we mean students are from outside the general disciplines of computer science or information technology. The two authors have taught two separate courses in two different universities in the United States. But the motivation, the course setting, and the experiences are very similar. And the challenges are very similar: how we can teach the Web search engines and communications network technology in general to undergraduate students who do not have previous computing background. The paper will concentrate on one course at Bucknell University in great detail first. (Course A.) The second course in California State University at Los Angels will be briefly described so the similar information will not be redundant. We will first describe the background, content, and structure for Course A. We then will discuss the pre and post course expectations. The assessment of the course will be discussed next, followed by a discussion of challenges and how we addressed them. We then will discuss the course at California State University \u2013 Los Angels (Course B), in which we will point out some similarities and differences between the two courses. Last we will conclude our discussion, drawing some lessons from our experiences and proposing future course of actions. A Foundation Seminar at Bucknell University: Search Engines and Our Lives Bucknell University requires its Arts and Science students to take a foundation seminar course during their first year (mostly in their first semester). Some Engineering students elect to take the seminar as well since it is very beneficial to the first-year engineering students. Here is a paraphrase quote from the university\u2019s course catalog about the foundation seminars. Each first-year student in the College of Arts and Sciences enrolls in a small seminar of about 15 students, usually in the fall semester. Foundation Seminars are offered by many different faculty and focus on a wide variety of subjects. Whatever the topics, they are designed to cultivate the attitudes, skills, and knowledge necessary for students to benefit maximally from a Bucknell University education and to negotiate the complexities of the modern world. The seminars stress the following: active, independent learning; collaborative learning; development of students\u2019 capacity for analysis, reflection, judgment, and creativity; multiple perspectives; and development of skills students need in order to engage in intellectual endeavors at Bucknell and beyond. These courses address foundation skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking and also develop students\u2019 ability to use the library effectively and to use computers (e.g. word processing, simulations, use of a database, or analysis of data). While the general outcomes of a foundation seminar at Bucknell University are cultivating the capability of life-long learning through reading, writing, listening, presentation, and becoming information literate, the specific goals of this foundation seminar FOUN 090-25: Search Engines and Our Lives are to make students aware of the general technologies used in a typical web search engine, understand the advantages and limitations of using search engines, appreciate the societal implications brought in by the search engines. Through the exercise of reading, writing, P ge 22407.3 presentation, and literature search in the seminar, students will become a better, more independent scholar after the seminar who is also knowledgeable about search engines. The foundation seminars target first year students from any majors on campus who may have no background in computer science. The learning outcomes of the foundation seminar, according to the university's catalog, are as follows. 1. Students will develop writing, reading, speaking, listening, and information literacy skills necessary for collegiate-level academic work. 2. Students will develop capacities for independent academic work and become more accountable for their own learning. We realize these outcomes by asking students to read papers, find extra references, synthesize what they read, write research papers, and present to the class of their findings. Because the seminar is intended for first-year non-major students in their first semester, the mathematics and computer science components from a typical web information retrieval course are removed from this seminar. Rather the seminar concentrates on general ideas of information retrieval and web search engines. For example, instead of studying detailed algorithms and data structures for inverted index systems, an essential component of any search engine, we just illustrate the ideas of inverted indexing using diagrams and explain how they work in an information retrieval system. We also spent a half of the semester on societal impacts of search engines investigating human side of the issues related to web search such as politics, health care, privacy, environment, e-commerce, academics, among others. We use the book Search Engine Society by Alexander Halavais as our main reference, accompanied by a number of other articles from research or popular publications. Alexander Halavais is a professor of communications at Quinnipiac University. His book contains a wealth collection of information about search engines and their social implications intended for general public. The book is suitable for first-year students of any major without background knowledge in computer science or information retrieval. The topics discussed in the seminar mainly follow the order of the book. We started with the basic building blocks of a search engine, followed by a brief history of search engines. We then presented a couple of examples of search engines, namely, AltaVista and Google, using research papers available to the public. The seminar then discussed various topics of search engine impacts on our lives listed at the end of previous paragraph. Instead of programming, students read, write, and present papers as they progress through the semester. Each week, students are asked to write a weekly reading journal based on the reading materials which can be a chapter from Halavairs' book, a conference paper, or a journal paper.

On the meteorology of the Lake District of Cumberland and Westmoreland, including the results of experiments on the fall of rain at various heights, up to 3166 feet above the sea-level.\u2014Fourth paper, for the year 1850", "abstract": "Introductory Remarks. In the month of December last I visited the Lake District, chiefly with the view of ascertaining approximately, the heights above the sea of some of the mountain gauges which I have hitherto been obliged to estimate. The heights of these stations were taken by means of an excellent aneroid barometer (previously compared with a standard), and a standard barometer read simultaneously, or nearly so, at the sea-level. By this method I found the height of Cockermouth above the sea to be 127 feet, Keswick 253 feet (Crosthwaite 258 feet), Bassenthwaite Lake and Lowdore (measured from Keswick) 214 and 224 feet respectively; Seathwaite (mean of two observations calculated from Lowdore) 368 feet; from Wastdale Head, 399 feet; and taken direct from the sea-level, 389 feet. I find the summit of Seatollar Common to be about 1590 feet, and the gauge 1388 feet above the sea, assuming the elevation of Seathwaite to be 368 feet; the gauge on Sprinkling Fell or the Stye, 948 feet, measured from Wastdale, and 936 feet by a simultaneous barometrical reading at the coast. Two distinct observations taken on the 16th and 17th of December, show the gauge near the top of Stye Head Pass to be 1443 and 1448 feet above the sea respectively, supposing the height of Wastdale Head village to be 247 feet. Mr. Otley states the summit of the Pass to be 1250 feet above the valley, or, taking Wastdale Head at 247 feet, 1497 feet above the sea; and an observation of Dr. Dalton\u2019s from the same base, gives 1506 feet, both of which correspond very nearly with my own results, as the gauge is somewhat below the highest part of the road leading over the Pass. I have hitherto stated the height of this station to be 1250 feet, but it appears I have misinterpreted my authority (Mr. Otley), whose calculation represents the height above the valley, not above the sea. The gauges on Brant Rigg and on Lingmell appear to be 924 and 1778 feet respectively above the sea. At the latter station, the barometer fell to 27\u221900 in., while in the valley it stood at 28\u221967 in., and at Whitehaven at 28\u221986 in. Temperature in the valley 48\u00b0; at 1778 feet, 32\u00b0\u22198, wet bulb 32\u00b0\u22192, heavy rain falling. I was prevented from ascending to any of the higher stations by the unfavourable state of the weather; indeed the barometrical observation at Brant Rigg, and also a second reading on Stye Head were taken at night, after having been confined to the valley the whole of the day by torrents of rain; I have consequently not had an opportunity of ascertaining the altitude of Sprinkling Tarn, but in 1812 Dr. Dalton states it to be 1860 feet; and another observation, either by Dalton or Otley, gives 1943 feet above the sea. 1 have therefore allowed the elevation of 1900 feet, previously given in my tables, to remain unaltered for the present. A complete and authentic table of the heights of our principal lakes and mountains is much wanted. Of the elevations given in the Guide Books to the Lake District, some are probably not far from the truth, but others are undoubtedly very erroneous; thus, Ennerdale Lake, by the Whitehaven Waterworks\u2019 Survey, proves to be 356 feet above the sea, instead of 246 feet, as stated in one of these treatises, showing an error or miscalculation of 110 feet. This is, no doubt, an extreme instance; but the altitudes of several of our lakes and mountains are yet unknown; and a careful measurement or remeasurement of the whole of them with accurate instruments and under favourable circumstances, is very desirable, as the results would be more or less interesting and valuable both to the meteorologist and the geologist, the botanist and the tourist.", "authors": ["John F.

The water of these lakes was first salt or brackish, as the remains of oysters and similar estuary forms show. By continental elevation the whole country west of the Mississippi was raised out of the cretaceous sea, and these estnaries became lakes inclosed by raised dry land. The knowledge of this country from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean has been accumulated by various explorers besides the writer, as Dr. Hayden, Mr. George Gibbs, Professors W. P. Blake and Thomas Antisell, and Prof. J. D. Whitney and the State Geological Survey of California, and Baron Richtofen, the lamented R\u00e9mond, Drs. Shiel, Wislizenus, and others. Besides Mr. Clarence King has explored a large tract of this country, but his very important contributions have not, as yet, been made public. The general character of the topography of the region west of the Mississippi has been given by these great lines of elevation traversing the country from north to south. There are the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Coast Ranges. The last is the most modern, and is composed, for the most part, of Miocene Tertiary rocks. Parallel with this lies a narrow trough, in California traversed by the Sacramento and San Joachin Rivers, encroached on by the mountains at places, but still in Oregon and Washington, traversed by the Willamette and Cowletz Rivers. These two sections are drained through the Golden Gate and Columbia. The mountain barriers formerly caused the valleys to consist of great inland lakes, which are now only represented by the chain of small pieces of water still to be seen in that region of country. East of the Sierra Nevada and between it and the Rocky Mountains is another still larger basin. For a thousand miles it has no openings to the westward, which are less than five thousand feet above the sea, but at three points there are gateways, which may be passed, but little above the sea level. These are the canons of the Sacramento (Pit River), the Klamath, and the Columbia. These have been out through by the drainage of the interior of the continent. The former beds of the lakes have thus been left dry and waste\u2014the only real desert on the North American continent. The Sierra Nevada is older than the Coast Ranges, and projected above the ocean, though not to its present altitude, previous to the Tertiary and even Cretaceous ages. This we learn from the fact that strata belonging to these formations cover its base. The mass of the Sierra Nevada is granitic rocks and metamorphic slates, proved Dy the California Survey to be triassic and jurassic. These slates are traversed by the gold-bearing quartz. East of the Sierra Nevada is a high and broad plateau five hundred miles wide, and from four to eight hundred feet in altitude, and reaches south into Mexico. This mountain belt was once the margin of the Pacific Ocean. Its crest is crowned by volcanic cones like gigantic towers of a fortification. The central portion of this plateau was called by Fremont \u201cthe great basin,\u201c as it forms a hydrographic basin drained by the Columbia and Colorado. The former makes its way to the ocean through a gorge in the Cascade Mountains, whilst the latter escapes to the south through a series of canons, of which the most important is nearly a thousand miles in length, and from three to six thousand feet deep. In vol. vi. ol the Pacific Railroad Reports the country of the Columbia is described and the reasons for concluding that it had cut its way through the Cascade Mountains, and similar facts were observed in the district drained by the Klamath and Pit Rivers. Certain peculiarities are to be seen in the country between the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains. In the northern and middle portions of the great table lands the surface is somewhat thickly set by short and isolated mountain ranges, sometimes called \u201cthe lost mountains.\u201d These rise like islands above the level of the plain, and are generally composed of volcanic or metamorphic rocks. The spaces between them are level desert surfaces. Towards the north and west, on the tributaries of the Columbia, Klamath, or Pit Rivers, the plateau is cut by these streams, and the deposit can be examined. The rocks are nearly horizontal, some are coarse volcanic ash, with fragments of pumice and scori\u00e6. Others denominated \u201cconcrete\u201dresemble the old Roman cement. Many are quite white, and are generally known as \u201cchalk-beds,\u201d though they contain no lime. The late Prof. J. W. Bailey determined these to consist of the remains of fresh-water species of Diatomace\u00e6. The stratification and horizontality of these beds show them to have been thrown down from great bodies of water which once covered the greater part of these level plains. From south-western Idaho and eastern Oregon have lately been brought large collections of animal and vegetable fossils, of great variety and interest. The plants were mostly collected by the Rev. Thomas Congdon, of the Dalles, Oregon, at great risk of life and while exposed to great hardships, on the flanks of the Blue Mountains. They are apparently Miocene, forming twenty or thirty species, nearly all new, and which represent a forest growth as varied and luxurious as can be found on any portion of the continent. The animal remains came mostly from the banks of Castle Creek in the Owyhee district, Idaho. These were sent by Mr. J. W. Adams of Ruby City. They consist of bones of the mastodon, rhinoceros, horse, elk, and other large mammals of which the species are probably in some cases new, in others identical with those obtained from the deposits examined by Dr. Hayden. There are also bones of birds and great numbers of the bones and teeth of fish. These last are cyprinoids applied to Mylopharodon, Milocheilus, & c., some three feet and more in length. Also many fresh-water shells, as Unio, Corbicula, Melania, and Planorbis. These illustrate the inhabitants of the extinct lakes, which were of a much larger size and greater depth than the great fresh-water lakes which now lie upon our northern frontier. Between these were areas covered with a luxuriant and beautiful vegetation and inhabited by herds of elephants and other great mammals. In the streams were numbers of fish and mollusks of species now extinct. Gradually these lakes evaporated and at last became dry. In the Klamath lakes and Suisun Bay we have their remanents, whilst on the Columbia the drainage streams have cut canons two thousand feet deep. At times the peace and quiet of this country were disturbed by violent volcanic eruptions from the peaks of the Sierra Nevada, which ejected showers of ashes covering the land and filling the lakes, as is seen in the strata now existing, some ten and twenty feet thick. Sometimes lava was thrown out and covered hundreds of miles of surface, and is now seen as solid basalt. Then quiet reigned, and new fresh-water deposits were formed, only to be succeeded by other volcanic disturbances. Some parts of this plateau have not been drained, and the remains of the ancient lakes now exist as Salt Lake, Pyramid Lake, and others. These are gradually diminishing, as is to be seen by indications all around their borders, where we can trace ancient shore lines. The alkali plains and salt flats mark the places of dried-up lakes; all of these still existing being excessively salt. This is the state of things at the north. In the south, the great Colorado plateau is without mountain barriers or local basins, and thers are few traces of extinct lakes. This arid district was once a beautiful and fertile plain, drained by the Colorado, which, on the western margin poured over a precipice five thousand feet or more high, into the Gulf of California, which then reached several thousand miles farther north than it does now. In time the river cut its way farther back through the subjacent rocks, and at last formed that remarkable gorge, nearly a thousand miles long and three to six thousand feet deep. As the channel deepened, the country around became dryer, until it was the arid plain we find it now. Almost no rain falls on this plain, there-fore the walls of the canon remain sharp-cut precipices unaffected by moisture. On the east of the Rocky Mountains is the great plateau country of the plains, which differs from the country to the west, by not being bordered on its east by a mountain chain, but sloping gradually to the Mississippi. Its surface was also covered by great fresh water lakes, larger, if not more numerous, than those now existing on our northern boundary. From the northern portion of this plateau Dr. Hayden has brought his specimens, and he has there obtained a harvest of scientific truth which will form for him an enduring and enviable monument. He has studied the deposits which accumulated in these lakes, and they are very rich in specimens of both animal and vegetable life. The vertebrate remains have been studied by Dr. Leidy, who has published his investigations in the splendid monograph so well known, and which forms a contribution to pal\u00e6ontology, not second in value or interest to that made by Cuvier, by his illustrations of the fossils from the Paris basin, nor to that of Falconer and Courtly, descriptive of the Sewalik hills of India. The first instalment of the plants have been described by Dr. Newberry, in the report of Colonel W. F. Reynolds, U.S.A., not yet published. The descriptions are published in the Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of New York, vol. 9, 1868. The general conclusions from these examinations have greatly enlarged the flora of the Tertiary and Cretaceous periods.

Thrombotic complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in polycythemia vera (PV). While the risk of PV thrombotic complications is significantly higher in patients with a previous history of thrombosis or transient ischemic attacks, advanced age (> 60 years), leukocytosis and possibly a high JAK2 V617F allelic burden, other contributing etiologies have not been excluded. It is unclear whether environmental variations including hypoxia could modify thrombosis risk. Chronic hypoxia induces many phenotypic changes, including increased erythropoietin production resulting in secondary erythrocytosis and pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, a congenital disorder of augmented hypoxia sensing at ambient oxygen tension, Chuvash polycythemia, is associated with a marked, yet unexplained, increased rate of thrombotic complications. Salt Lake City, UT is located in a valley at ~5,000 feet of altitude and the surrounding areas from which PV patients are referred ranges from 4,300 to 6,900 feet in altitude. In this area, the average hemoglobin concentration is 0.6\u20131.3 gm/dL higher than the average US value, indicating a physiological response to this level of hypoxia. To analyze the possible effect of moderate hypoxia on PV thrombotic complications, we retrospectively compared the history of thrombotic complications in PV patients from Salt Lake City and Baltimore, MD, a city with a referral area in which the elevation is Patients from Salt Lake City were older than the Baltimore patients, more often male, and had longer disease duration. A history of thrombosis was present in 58% of the Salt Lake City patients compared to 27% of the Baltimore patients (P The analysis suggests that hypoxia may modify the PV phenotype. The degree of HIF-1 and HIF-2 augmentation and altered regulation of their target genes, and the potential for increased thrombotic risk due to environmental hypoxia should be evaluated prospectively in PV patients living at different altitudes.

As indicated in fig. i, the valley embraces parts of five counties. Throughout, its surface forms are of glacial origin and, with the exception of the immediate borders of the river, have undergone but slight modification since glacial times. Perhaps its most striking topographic features are the rough morainic hills of its upper and middle courses, and the gently undulating plain of its lower course. The river has its source in west-central Oakland County in Big Lake, 9 miles (14. 5km) southeast of Holly and approximately 40 miles (64km) northwest of Detroit. Starting with an elevation of 950 feet (290m), after a course, extending for 50 miles (8okm) generally southwestward and then for another 50 miles (80km) southeastward, it empties into Lake Erie at an altitude of 573 feet (I75m) above tide. As is common in areas of glacial deposition, the topography of the drainage basin of the Huron has little of the appearance usually suggested by the term \"valley.\" The upper two-thirds of its course is a winding depression among morainic knobs, lake basins, abandoned glacial drainage channels, and sand plains. Here the river is characterized by long reaches and occasional slight riffles. At intervals it broadens into stretches of lake-like character, as is illustrated by such bodies of water as Commerce, Taylor, Strawberry, Wrhitewood, and Bass Lakes, each with an area of one-fourth to one-half a square mile (65-I30 hectares).

Eastern South Dakota lies on the Great Plains, in the broad, indefinite zone in which these plains merge into the prairies of the Mississippi Valley. It is comprised within the area of glaciation, and most of the surface features present the characteristics of a drift-covered region. The country is mostly level or presents low, rolling slopes rising out of broad expanses of plains. The principal elements of relief are long ranges of hills of moderate elevation due to morainal accumulations left by the ice along lines marking various pauses of glacial advance and retreat. Further diversity of topography has been produced by the excavation of the valleys, especially the valley of the Missouri, which has cut a trench several hundred feet deep, mostly with steeply sloping sides. Between the moraines there are rolling plains of till and very level plains due to the filling up of glacial lakes. The upper James Biver Valley presents a notable example of this lake-bed topography. Location. The Alexandria quadrangle is bounded by parallels 43\u00b0 30' and 44\u00b0 north latitude and meridians 97\u00b0 30' and 98\u00b0 west longitude, and covers a quarter of a square degree. It is approximately 35 miles in length and 25 1 miles in breadth, and has an area of about 863 square miles. The quadrangle is in the James Biver Valley; the greater portion of it is included in Hanson County, and the remainder is in Miner, Sanborn, McCook, and Davison counties, South Dakota. Topography. The surface of the quadrangle is a nearly smooth plain sloping gently toward James Biver, which flows along the western border of the quadrangle on the north and crosses its southwestern quarter. No very abrupt or rough surface, except a few knolls that will be mentioned further on, is cfound away from the immediate vicinity of the streams. The highest point in the quadrangle is in the northeast corner, where the altitude is 1560 feet above sea level. The lowest point is on James Biver at the southern boundary of the quadrangle, the altitude there being about 1190 feet. In the northwestern portion of the quadrangle, embracing the area lying between James Biver and Bock Creek, is a very even plain having a general altitude of 1310 feet. In this plain the streams have cut narrow, gorge-like channels, and there are several isolated lake basins. Most of these contain water during only a part of the year, but in the southwestern portion of Beaver Township (T. 105 N., B. 58 W.) there are several small lakes which are permanent. The southwestern part of the quadrangle is somewhat rougher, owing to the presence not only of James Biver and several important tributary streams but of a number of sharp gravelly and rocky hills and ridges. These form portions of the Gary moraine, which will be discussed in some detail later. Some of the higher points, as along Enemy Creek on the western border and in sec. 29, Hanson Township (T. 103 N., B. 59 W.), rise to 1380 feet above sea level, with moderately steep slopes. The northeastern and central portions of the quadrangle, while smoother than the southwestern part, are rougher than , the plain west of Bock Creek. There is a general slope to the west, which, east of Wolf Creek, amounts to as much as 50 feet to the mile. The surface here, as throughout the quadrangle, presents the usual features of a glacial drift plain. There are numerous basins and shallow ponds, which occasionally hold water the year round. There is a large basin in the northern part of Spring Lake Township (T. 104 N., B. 57 W.) and another on the south line of Benton Township (T. 103 N., B. 56 W.). The entire quadrangle is within the prairie region, though in the bends of James Biver and along its steeper bluffs, as well as at a few points along Enemy Creek, there are small groves. These include cottonwood, willow, elm, ash, maple, and a few cedar trees. Drainage. The drainage of the quadrangle has been greatly influenced by the former occupation of the region by an ice sheet, as will be more fully explained under the heading \"Pleistocene system.\" The principal stream is James Biver, which in this quadrangle flows through a trough about 30 miles in length. This trough is usually about 100 feet in depth, but in some places in the vicinity of the moraines it deepens to 140 feet. It has abrupt sides and an alluvial bottom averaging over half a mile in breadth. The entire quadrangle is drained by James Biver and its tributaries with the exception of about 2 square miles in the northeast corner, which lies in the basin of Vermilion Biver. The principal tributary of James Biver is Wolf Creek, which flows entirely across the quadrangle from north to south at an average distance of about 5 miles from the eastern margin. It receives numerous short tributaries from the east. It is the only stream in this quadrangle on the east side of James Biver containing permanent flowing water, a feature which, however, is found for only a few miles of its course above the southern boundary. The next important stream entering the James on the east is Bock Creek, which is formed by two branches rising west of the head of Wolf Creek, and flows southwest to James Biver, joining it just above its junction with the Firesteel. Two shorter tributaries, Johnson Creek and Pierre Creek, rise in the northern part of Spring Lake Township (T. 104 N., B. 57 W.) and enter the James between Bock and Wolf creeks. Other shorter and less important watercourses also enter the James from the east. From the west, James Biver receives in this quadrangle two streams, the Firesteel, whose course is mostly outside the quadrangle, and Enemy Creek, which flows nearly due east for about 7 miles through the middle of Bosedale Township (T. 102 N., B. 59 W.). Crossing Borne and Worthen townships is Twelvemile Creek, which has permanent water below sec. 20, Worthen Township, at which point there is a large spring.", "authors": ["B. J. Todd", "C. M.

Violence at U.S. protests The new data on fatalities and violence at American protests comes from a database created by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED), a non-profit, working in collaboration with a group of researchers at Princeton. ACLED, a widely cited source for data on civilian casualties in Yemen, has been a non-partisan monitor of protests and violence in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Latin America, and launched its U.S. Crisis Monitor in July, citing concerns over hate crimes and rising political violence. ACLED found that the overwhelming majority of the more than 9.000 Black Lives Matter demonstrations that took place across the U.S. after the killing of George Floyd have been peaceful. News reports at the height of demonstrations over Floyd\u2019s killing cited dozens of deaths in connection with protests, but many of those turned out to be examples of deadly crimes carried out in the vicinity of protests, rather than directly related to the demonstrations themselves, the researchers concluded.

A: There will be large shifts in policy if Biden wins the election. Some of that depends on the outcome of senate control as well. If Democrats have a majority in the Senate in addition to the house and the presidency, there will be larger policy changes. These will be on both the domestic policy and foreign policy fronts. He has not been particularly transparent regarding actual plans for foreign policy changes. I believe it is likely that Biden will embrace liberalism as a strategy regarding international relations. This is contrary to Trump\u2019s realist approach and is similar to what the Obama administration implemented. This will possibly bring a willingness to renegotiate a nuclear plan of action with Iran, significantly reduce sanctions, and negotiate agreements with other countries.

Indeed, over the past four years under Trump\u2019s administration, without question, the two countries\u2019 relationship had experienced a trying period. Not only did the top officials of the two countries have rounds of negotiations about trade tariffs and intellectual property, among others, but the trade dispute also affected the exchange of people between the two countries. For example, according to Forbes magazine, the number of Chinese tourists to the US declined by 10% in 2018 and another 5% plus in the first five months in 2019. To put this in context, this decline was the very first time compared with the previous decade that had actually seen a steady increase of Chinese visitors to the US. Oddly and unjustly, the increased tension between the two countries\u2019 relationship also affected the lives of many Chinese Americans living in the US. Toward the end of 2020, for example, the Ministry of Commerce threatened to end the operation of WeChat, a social media platform exceedingly popular among the majority of Chinese working or touring in the US, on the charge that it had made illegal transactions. Meanwhile, a number of Chinese scientists working in the US, many of them are naturalized citizens, were persecuted by the FBI on alleged charges of espionage or grant fraud. Days before Trump left the White House, Chen Gang, a China-born US citizen, and a widely respected scientist teaching at MIT, was arrested on allegations that he had mishandled federal grants and committed tax fraud. If the US\u2013China relationship has become strained over the past several years, it seems that the Chinese government is not blameless either. Concerning the decrease of Chinese visitors and students in the US, it was partially attributed to the policy instituted by the Chinese government in recent years that limited the transferring of funds from China to the US and any other foreign countries, which greatly impeded Chinese tourists and students from visiting or studying in the US. And, it appears that the trade disputes between the two countries also have something to do with the long-existing Chinese regulation that levies a high surcharge on imported goods, ranging from automobiles to cosmetics. Labeled usually as \u201cluxury items,\u201d many of the American products are sold in China at a marked-up price, which could sometimes be 20 or 30% higher than that in the US. As of now, both phenomena persist in China, despite the government\u2019s rhetoric for improving its relationship with the US. In other words, for the US\u2013China relationship to improve for the better, it requires a bilateral and collaborative effort from both sides in the years to come. The inauguration of the Biden administration early this year might be a new point of departure. On the other side of the Pacific, however, it seems that the Chinese government has taken the \u201cwait-and-see\u201d stance; few encouraging signs have so far been given by Xi Jinping and his inner circles. \u201cHistory makes one wise,\u201d Francis Bacon enjoined us several centuries before.

The new law brings a multitude of changes affecting both 2012 returns and, for the new year, tax planning, withholding, and estimated tax payments, prompting many considerations for CPAs and their clients concerning implementation of the new measures. In addition, new taxes and provisions enacted in 2010 by health care reform legislation took effect Jan. 1. Shortly before 2 a.m. on Jan. 1, the Senate passed by a vote of 89-8 the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, H.R. 8, which embodied an agreement that had been hammered out over the preceding two days between Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. The House of Representatives approved the bill by a vote of 257-167 late that evening, after plans to amend the bill to include spending cuts were abandoned. President Barack Obama signed the bill Jan. 2. \"The AICPA is pleased that an agreement has been signed into law,\" said Edward Karl, vice president--Tax for the AICPA. \"Besides allowing the IRS and tax software providers to implement critically needed administrative plans and updates for the current tax season, the act should now enable taxpayers to make informed decisions and businesses to get on with their long-term tax and cash flow planning. The AICPA has been working with our members to help them understand and implement these changes in the tax law We also will continue to closely follow tax-related developments as the next chapter in the legislative saga unfolds.\" The act's impact on tax season was not immediately known. The IRS issued a statement on Jan. 2 saying that it was assessing what effect the act would have. The IRS released updated withholding tables on Jan. 3. With some modifications targeting the wealthiest Americans with higher taxes, the act permanently extends provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, P.L. 107-16 (EGTRRA), and Jobs and Growth Tax Relief-Reconciliation Act of 2003, P.L. 108-27 (JGTRRA). It also permanently takes care of Congress's perennial job of \"patching\" the alternative minimum tax (AMT). It temporarily extends many other tax provisions that briefly lapsed at midnight on Dec. 31, 2012, and others that had expired a year earlier. The act's nontax features include one-year extensions of emergency unemployment insurance and agricultural programs and yet another \"doc fix\" postponement of automatic cuts in Medicare payments to physicians. In addition, it delays until March a broad range of automatic federal spending cuts known as sequestration that otherwise would have begun immediately Among the tax items not addressed by the act was the temporary lower 4.2% rate for employees' portion of the Social Security payroll tax, which was not extended and has reverted to 6.2%. Certain taxpayers also face higher taxes starting in 2013 as a result of provisions also described below that were enacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation. Here are the act's main tax features: INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX RATES All the individual marginal tax rates under EGTRRA and JGTRRA are retained (10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%). A new top rate of 39.6% is imposed on taxable income over $400,000 for single fliers, $425,000 for head-of-household fliers, and $450,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly ($225,000 for each married spouse filing separately).

AARP, formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons, was under fire. Two Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee--Wally Herger (Representative, California) and Dave Reichert (Representative, Washington)--had recently issued their 40-page Investigative Report, Behind the Veil: The AARP America Doesn't Know. Although not an author of the report, Charles Boustany (Representative, Louisiana) headed the subcommittee from which the report was launched and was also instrumental in initiating related criticisms against AARP. The press, the American public, and rival Democrats were at loggerheads, engaged in an intense debate over whether AARP was a legitimate tax-exempt organization or a colossal for-profit enterprise--given that many of AARP's activities were potentially inconsistent with those of a non-profit organization. Fox News summarized the issues as follows: Charitable contributions to AARP had not increased substantially during a time when AARP's revenue from insurance products--ostensibly a for-profit activity--had tripled. Instead, the organization's former CEO's salary had increased 80%, and AARP had become the fourth highest-spending lobbying organization in the nation. Fox News also had reported specific concerns about AARP's lobbying for the Obama administration's healthcare law. The news agency stated the new law \"cut $500 billion from Medicare spending, leading critics to ask if AARP had a conflict of interest. Government experts predicted the cuts in Medicare would push seniors into Medigap insurance--the product from which AARP makes the most money\" (Angle, 2011, np). While largely echoing Fox News' summary of the issues, NPR also reported briefly on Democrats' responses to Herger and Reichert's report. For example, John Lewis (Representative, Georgia) had retorted, \"This is nothing other than a political witch hunt. The Ways and Means Committee is better than this\" (Overby, 2011, np). Had AARP violated the requirements of its tax-exempt status? And what exactly were those requirements? Or was Herger and Reichert's report simply political backlash? In other words, were these Republicans responding to AARP's support for President Obama's healthcare law? Remember, this was not Congress's first investigation of AARP's tax-exempt status. Congressional hearing were held in the 1990's by Senator Simpson who later reflected that AARP was \"the biggest marketing operation in America and money-maker\" and an organization whose practices were \"the greatest abuse of American generosity I witnessed in my time in the U.S. Senate\" (Editorial, 2011). Organization of AARP AARP originated in 1947 when its founder--Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus--first advocated on behalf of an impoverished former teacher who had had to resort to living in a chicken coop. In 1958, Andrus's assistance to the elderly inspired the formation of AARP, Inc.--a social welfare organization exempt from tax under Section 501(c)(4) with the generic purpose of \"promoting the interests of older persons\" (KPMG: AARP Consolidated Financial Statements, 2011, p. 6). Despite humble origins, AARP held over $2.5 billion in total assets as a consolidated entity by the time Herger and Reichert published their Congressional report in 2011. The entity had generated over $1.3 billion in total operating revenue in 2010 alone. The organizational structure behind this impressive wealth had grown considerably since AARP's inception as well. In fact by April 2011, AARP (\"the consolidated entity\") was comprised of AARP, Inc. and at least seven other for-profit, tax-exempt, and pass-through affiliates: 1. Together, AARP Foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary AARP Institute were known as the Foundation. Tax exempt under Section 501(c)(3), the Foundation was designed to assist \"vulnerable\" persons 50 years of age and over obtain \"the essentials--food, housing, income, and personal connection--and achieve their best life\" (KPMG: AARP Consolidated Financial Statements, 2011, p. \u2026", "authors": ["Kathryn Simms", "Jeffry Netter"], "citations": 1, "venue": "", "year": 2013}, "5": {"title": "Culture of corruption : Obama and his team of tax cheats, crooks, and cronies", "abstract": "The era of hope and change is dead...and it only took six months in office to kill it.

In Culture of Corruption, Malkin reveals: * Why nepotism beneficiaries First Lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are Team Obama's biggest liberal hypocrites--bashing the corporate world and influence-peddling industries from which they and their relatives have benefited mightily * What secrets the ethics-deficient members of Obama's cabinet--including Hillary Clinton--are trying to hide * Why the Obama White House has more power-hungry, unaccountable \"czars\" than any other administration * How Team Obama's first one hundred days of appointments became a litany of embarrassments as would-be appointee after would-be appointee was exposed as a tax cheat or had to withdraw for other reasons * How Obama's old ACORN and union cronies have squandered millions of taxpayer dollars and dues money to enrich themselves and expand their power * How Obama's Wall Street money men and corporate lobbyists are ruining the economy and helping their friendsIn Culture of Corruption, Michelle Malkin lays bare the Obama administration's seamy underside that the liberal media would rather keep hidden.", "authors": ["Michelle L.

Polls show that African Americans are among the strongest supporters of vouchers, tax credits, and charter schools (see \"What Americans Think about Their Schools,\" features, Fall 2007). If minority leaders can be weaned away from traditional alliances, the underlying public support will translate into effective legislative action, especially if choice laws focus on schools in urban areas. All of that sounds convincing in theory, but the reality can be quite different. In state after state, when legislators introduce proposals aimed at moving students out of failing schools, activists emerge to delay, block, or sabotage the plans. The legislative history of the 2005 and 2006 tuition grant proposals in the Missouri House of Representatives offers some insights into how complex the political game can become, even when support from minority legislators is substantial. The Missouri plan was designed to avoid the controversial label \"school voucher.\" Rather than reallocating dollars slated for education, supporters proposed to give tax credits to individuals and businesses that donated money to nonprofit organizations providing low-income students with scholarship grants to attend private schools (see Table 1). Described this way, the legislation had the initial support of a broad coalition of Republicans and Democrats, blacks and whites. Not surprisingly, the teachers unions mounted a vigorous campaign against the bill. Under that pressure, the tuition grant coalition fell apart during the legislative process, revealing sharp divisions within the ranks of blacks and Republicans. The Battleground As elsewhere, school reform in Missouri takes place amid racially polarized municipal politics. School budget crises are continuous, teachers union leadership is combative, and minority community involvement is generally ineffective. Although the legislative maneuvering took place in Jefferson City, the state capital, the real audience for the tuition grant debate was the city of St. Louis. The politics of the St. Louis schools is a black community affair. Many of the current school leaders were in the forefront of efforts to desegregate the schools beginning in the 1970s. Jim Buford, president of the St. Louis Urban League and founder of the Black Leadership Roundtable, explained, \"public schools are engrained into the fabric of the community.\" African Americans represent about half of the city's population, and 81 percent of the public school enrollment. About 80 percent of St. Louis students are in the free and reduced-price school lunch program. Unfortunately, the quality of the schools declined sharply after their peak 1983 AAA state rating; the dropout rate is high and student achievement low. By 2005, the district was only partially accredited, a serious situation with no clear solution at hand. St. Louis has a strong public school cartel, an alliance of teachers union leaders, central board administrators, and various public-school interest groups that has an established routine for managing the schools and is typically skeptical of any proposal for change. The cartel acts as a veto player in school policymaking. Members are linked by churches, social organizations, and school ties, and these personal and political relationships drive the group's success. Political scientist Marion Orr refers to such connections as \"bonds of personalism.\" [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] The city's print media--including the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which enjoys a national reputation--monitor the black leadership class and report on its interaction with the school system. St. Louis also has three African American weeklies that are widely read by both black opinion leaders and the public.

Approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in March, I first learned of this product, called Palcohol, from an editorial by Julie Miller on April 23, 2015, on www.behavioral.net/news. I found the news concerning, because packets of alcohol powder could easily be concealed and added to drinks of unsuspecting individuals (for example, women who think they are consuming fruit punch at a fraternity party). Miller\u2019s article cited Tom Whiting, founder of Discovery House, who warned of tragic consequences if the product were consumed by children and adolescents (Miller, 2015). To children, the process of mixing up a tasty alcoholic drink would be very similar to making a pitcher of lemonade and could seem just as harmless. The advantages of powdered alcohol, as listed on www.palcohol.com, include convenience for campers and hikers who would not have to carry bottled liquor, and for airlines, which could reduce the weight of their planes by replacing liquid alcohol with powdered alcohol. The headline on the home page of this web site claims that \u201cPalcohol is safer than liquid alcohol\u201d (Anonymous, no date). Disputing the safety of the new product, Naimi and Mosher (2015), writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), list its many disadvantages, such as the potential for overdose. Palcohol is 50% alcohol by weight and, if mixed as directed on the packet, yields a liquid that is 10% alcohol. However, the likelihood that users will disobey the mixing instructions appears to be strong. The JAMA article echoes the concerns of Whiting about consumption by youth, recalling the popularity of flavored alcoholic beverages and alcoholic Jello shots that entered the market without adequate legislative scrutiny. Children and adolescents could easily sneak packets of powdered alcohol into venues where liquor is forbidden, such as schools, stadiums, parks, and theaters. I believe it is imperative for psychiatric-mental health nurses to become well informed about Palcohol and active in lobbying for legislation to restrict or ban its sale. At this writing, 12 states have passed laws to ban Palcohol. Check and see if your state is one of them. If not, I hope you will voice your concern in the public debate.", "authors": ["Sandra P.

As the Trump administration teams with a Republican Congress eager to loosen regulations, this will inevitably jolt government agencies that play critical roles in drug discovery, development and market access. Campaign-era promises to dissolve or renegotiate global trade deals and drug-pricing positions remain wildcards for industry. Meanwhile, tax reforms may turn up the heat on industry\u2019s already warm climate for acquisitions. A top priority will be the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) healthcare reform law. (Nat. Biotechnol. 28, 385\u2013386, 2010). Obamacare, as it is commonly known, appears extremely vulnerable as it has been chief among Republican bugbears since its enactment in 2010. But the full repealand-replace promised often by vociferous Republicans (including Trump) over the past several years may not be legislatively possible. And it would leave 20 million Americans with no access to health insurance. For biotech, a PPACA repeal would remove the nascent biosimilar approvals pathway that was created as part of Obamacare, and would reduce the number of US citizens who can afford new drugs. A brief policy outline posted to Trump\u2019s website two days after the election promised to replace the PPACA. But \u201cthe only honest answer is that no one really knows\u201d what exactly will happen to President Obama\u2019s signature healthcare reform law, says Michael McCaughan, founder of health policy analysis firm Prevision Policy in Washington, DC. Congressional Republicans who long sought the law\u2019s repeal, \u201cnever expected to be in this position,\u201d he says. With Trump as president and Republicans controlling Congress, US federal spending will most probably shrink. Any cuts could have negative ramifications for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Obama-era NIH projects that require Congressional funding. Hopes that the new administration might embrace scientific rigor received an early blow when a climate change contrarian Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, DC, was tapped by Trump to lead the transition at the US Environmental Protection Agency. As of mid-November Trump hadn\u2019t disclosed any actual policy positions related to the NIH, but during a radio interview with Michael Savage in October, he stated: \u201cI hear so much about the NIH, and it\u2019s terrible.\u201d Initiatives that are key to Obama\u2019s legacy will likely be under renewed scrutiny. Funding to support the $350-million neuroscience research program BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) (Nat. Biotechnol. 31, 460, 2013) and the patient-empowered Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) (Nat. Biotechnol. 33, 325, 2015), a large-scale research effort aimed at gathering and linking genomic, phenotypic and lifestyle data to accelerate R&D, could be in jeopardy. The fate of the Cancer Moonshot program, launched in early 2016 to facilitate collaboration and data sharing in oncology, with a goal to double the rate of progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment, also remains unclear. Moonshot is spearheaded by Vice President Joe Biden, and includes industry players, clinicians and academic institutions (Nat. Biotechnol. 34, 118, 2016). It enjoys widespread support and, before the election, Moonshot leaders expressed optimism about the program\u2019s momentum. \u201cWe can get a lot of things started that are not going to stop regardless of what happens to the Moonshot as a governmental entity,\u201d Washington, DC\u2013based Moonshot executive director Greg Simon noted during a November 4 conference convened by the Washington, DC\u2013based research advocacy group Friends of Cancer Research and Prevision Policy. The fate of NIH\u2019s recently announced clinical trial access and data transparency policies is now uncertain. These apolitical aspirations related to Moonshot announced in October (JAMA 316, 1353\u20131354, 2016), including improved access to clinical trials and better communication between NIH cancer centers, are unlikely to be controversial. But although Simon reached out to the Trump campaign about the future of the Moonshot, he has yet to receive a response. Still, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been in Washington since 1985...and I\u2019ve never been associated with a program that has more bipartisan support and more excitement from the average citizen than the Moonshot.\u201d At least in some form, the Obama administration\u2019s projects will survive the transition to Trump\u2019s presidency, health policy experts agree. It\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019d be funded at Obama administration levels, but \u201cif there\u2019s anything that\u2019s enjoyed bipartisan support, it\u2019s funding for the NIH,\u201d says Ian Spatz, senior advisor at Washington, DC, healthcare consultancy Manatt Health and a former vice president of public policy at Merck & Co. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine there\u2019ll be any change in that going forward,\u201d he says, and what\u2019s more, \u201cit would be really smart politically for the president-elect to embrace Joe Biden\u2019s Moonshot.\u201d Issues around drug pricing may vex the Trump administration as much as its London reacts to the US presidential election.

Straddling private and public law, relevant topics that could have fallen into the category of \"hot\" in 2015 but did not get included in the survey panel were comparative resale royalty right schemes, destruction of Islamic art and cultural patrimony in the ISIS-occupied territories of Syria and Iraq, and tax issues for the expanding global art market. In short, in the 21st century, there is a plethora of art law and cultural property subjects ripe for examination through an international law prism. Ultimately, the three topics featured this year included: (1) difficulties and innovations in authentication of visual arts and the use of scientific analysis to facilitate the process of separating the authentic art works from the proliferating fakes; (2) discussion of the efforts to halt the sale of Native American sacred objects in France; and (3) property claims involving the cultural property nationalized after Fidel Castro came to power following the Cuban revolution. These topics were selected both for their novelty and their urgency. Just as more and more authentication committees began offering opinions regarding pieces submitted to them for examination, the 165-year old Knoedler Gallery collapsed in 2011 due to the confirmed allegations that it sold fakes. The dozens of lawsuits filed by defrauded collectors set off a chain reaction in the art market. James Martin of Orion Labs, who served as an expert witness for some of the Knoedler lawsuits, addressed the need for due diligence and the benefits offered by testing art works in lab settings. Mari-Claudia Jimenez, a Partner at the Herrick Feinstein LLP firm in New York, presented a paper on the Cuban art from private collections that ended up in the national museums in Cuba. Some of these artworks have been trickling out from Cuba to find their way to the art market and the auctions in the United States and Europe. Pierre Ciric, founder of the Ciric Law Firm, discussed the efforts made by him and others on behalf of the Hopi Tribe in order to preclude the French auction houses from selling sacred Native American materials. While the Hopi sacred objects are communal property and cannot be sold by any individual in the Tribe, there have been ongoing auctions of these objects at Hotel Drouot in Paris since 2013. Yet, under tribal custom and tribal, state, and federal law, these objects cannot be sold or given away by any individual. As a result, the sale of such items constitutes the sale of stolen property, which is obviously legally prohibited in the United States and around the world. The Hopi Tribe first enacted statutes specifically prohibiting the sale of the sacred objects in the 1970s. Trafficking in these objects is in violation of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Nevertheless a government body called the \"Conseil des Ventes Volontaires\" has denied standing to the Tribe and Tribe members in their efforts to obtain adjudication of their claims involving cultural property stolen in the United States and subsequently transported to France. As recently as June 1, 2015 and June 11, 2015, more sacred Native American objects were being auctioned off in France with impunity to the consignor(s). Cultural Heritage and the Arts Interest Group is a platform for American Society of International Law members to discuss and learn about art and cultural property matters that affect not only world patrimony but also involve international trade and diplomacy. \u2026", "authors": ["Mari-Claudia Jim\u00e9nez"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2015}}, "39": {"0": {"title": "Identity, activism and hatred : hate speech against migrants on Facebook in the Czech Republic in 2015", "abstract": "The increased influx of refugees and migrants to the EU in 2015 has been followed by a noticeable presence of online hate speech against migrants in many countries across Europe. The article presents the results of a study of hate speech proliferation on Facebook in the Czech Republic during the summer of 2015. Its goal is to identify the producers of hate speech and determine their social background, explore the main channels of hate speech proliferation, determine the specific groups of migrants targeted by hate speech, put the hate speech in the context of online political communication, and discuss the role of media and politicians in the process of hate speech proliferation. With regard to the works of Castells, Skocpol or Bennett and Segerberg, online hate speech can be perceived as an extreme variety of new, rapidly evolving modes of political communication as such. Social and political activism has been shifting from membership-based organizations and parties towards flexible movements and initiatives with strong emphasis on the logic of identity politics. People may or may not engage in hate speech production as lone independent actors, but they still perceive their actions as part of larger collective efforts. When we focus on hate speech as a form of civic activism or networking, new interesting patterns can emerge. The study is based on a mixed-method analysis; computer-assisted data collection via the Social Insider software tool was further triangulated by random sampling and subsequent manual coding and analysis of selected Facebook posts, comments and other content. The question of reception and influence of hate speech was largely omitted from the analysis, due both to the research methods chosen and to the inherently cyclical nature of social network communication. Hate speech itself was identified according to a custom-made definition based on various existing legal definitions and scholarly perspectives of legal and media science. The results of the analysis indicate that the wave of hate speech against migrants was aggravated both intentionally and coincidentally by the combined forces of disparate Facebook users, extremist groups\u2019 propaganda, news media and the design of the social network itself. As for the social background of frequent producers of hate speech, there was a strong prevalence of middle-aged and middle-class males, and a significant under-representation of both elderly and young Facebook users. The majority of the hate speech content was produced and spread in small-scale communication exchanges, i.e. under articles posted on individual user profiles etc. The communication activities of larger, well-organized populist groups, political parties or communities were visibly present, but they did not play a significant part in the hate speech production itself \u2013 although their possible involvement in agenda setting cannot be underestimated. All the datasets indicated that a vast majority of the hate speech in the given time period was aimed either against migrants in general or Muslims, while these two groups often overlapped. The role of mass media and of the design of the Facebook platform in the entire process should be discussed further. It became apparent that the producers of hate speech themselves seldom created any substantial shared content such as articles or videos. To the contrary, many hateful comments occurred through sharing and subsequent discussion of articles produced by online news outlets. As the Czech mass media are defined by transformation, uncertainty, layoffs and disintegration of professional routines, this creates a dangerous mix that could lead to further proliferation of hate speech. The same can be said about the platform design of Facebook and other social networks \u2013 their balkanizing and polarizing effects on public communication are already well described by scholars such as Connover, Pariser, Morozov and many others, and the present study only further supports their findings and theories.", "authors": ["Matou\u0161 Hrdina"], "citations": 8, "venue": "", "year": 2016}, "1": {"title": "Information disorders on Italian Facebook during COVID-19 infodemic", "abstract": "In this work we carry out an exploratory analysis of online conversations on the Italian Facebook during the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

More specifically, we investigated the presence of four frames: the intruder frame, the victim frame, the wealth gap frame and the win-win frame (Van Gorp et al., 2018). We collected statements on migration or migrants made by Flemish politicians between 1 January 2016 and 30 June 2018 in four different types of media. We selected the five most read national newspapers: Het Laatste Nieuws, Het Nieuwsblad, De Standaard, De Morgen, and De Tijd. The television news items were collected from the 19h daily newscast VTM Nieuws (commercial broadcaster) and 19h daily newscast Het Journaal (public broadcaster VRT, Een). On Twitter and Facebook, we included the official accounts of the political parties as well as the official accounts of their most important politicians (party leaders, Ministers and State Secretaries in the Federal and Flemish government, party experts on migration). In each of the four media, the units of registration are the statements by Flemish politicians containing at least one of the keywords \u201cmigration\u201d or \u201cmigrant\u201d. We only selected the verbatim quotes by politicians. The newspaper data were collected through the GoPress database, the TV items through the ENA (Elektronisch Nieuwsarchief) database, the Twitter data using the Twitter API, and the Facebook data by means of a manual scraping (due to practical limitations only the 50 most recent posts). The study was conducted by two independent coders. The intercoder reliability test resulted in strong kappa values (ranging from 0.617 to 1). \n \nWe collected 1528 statements of 82 politicians representing the six parties; 47.9% (732) from N-VA, 27.1% (414) Vlaams Belang, 8.2% (125) Open Vld, 6.0% (91) CD&V, 5.9% (90) sp.a, and 5.0% (76) Groen. Importantly, only 245 of these statements contain one of the four researched frames (16.0%). This is not a surprise, since a lot of quotes are just factual and too short to contain framing or reasoning devices. The intruder frame is by far the most used frame (73.1%), followed by the victim frame (22.0%), wealth gap frame (3.7%), and win -win frame (1.2%). Vlaams Belang (38.8%) had the most framed statements, shortly followed by N-VA (35.9%). Both parties used the intruder frame the most. In contrast, the other four parties used the victim frame the most. We also found differences in frame use depending on the media type. The overrepresentation of the intruder frame on Twitter and television is related to the dominance of N -VA and Vlaams Belang accounts in these platforms. We also compared the framed statements in the media to the official views as carried out in the parties\u2019 election programs (2014) which turn out to be more neutral, less emotional and comprise more alternatively framed statements about migration.", "authors": ["Sarah Van Leuven", "Annelore Deprez", "Stijn Joye", "David Ongenaert", "Joke D\u2019Heer"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2019}, "4": {"title": "Sentiment analysis of the user comments with the theme of migration posted as interactive content on the Hospod\u00e1rske noviny website", "abstract": "This paper reflects on the current discourse on migration in the Slovak digital environment. Given the need to examine the perception of migrants, and using the analysis of comments and posts, it captures social events. It views migration from the perspective of online readers of the Hospod\u00e1rske noviny daily who send their feedback through interactive tools and actively respond to the media news and stories labeled with the \"migrants\u201d tag. The new authentic digital content is thereby considered a specific type of content \u2013 the so-called \"user-generated content\u201d (UGC). From the reader's perspective, it is one of the ways to show interest in the posts and/or news articles and express one's opinion. On the other hand, UGC also belongs to some of the highly influential tools that can affect the thinking and perception of other readers of UGC. Because UGC is largely involved in shaping the attitude of the online public and formation of public opinion, this type of digital content needs to be analyzed and steered in the desired way through an effective impact on users and/or contributors of digital content. The aim of our research is to find out how the active online readers of Hospod\u00e1rske noviny view migrants in their nonanonymous comments. Using the content analysis method, and implementing the analysis of sentiment in the nonanonymous user comments (linked with their profiles on Facebook), we analyze (A) the specifics of online readers of the Hospod\u00e1rske noviny daily and (B) the polarity of user comments posted by the online readers as a specific type of UGC. The sentiment of comments was measured with ternary classification, dividing the individual items into classes of positive (+1), neutral (0) and negative (-1) sentiment in the \"men\" and \"women\u201d category. The data were collected on the hnonline.sk website in the period 1.1.2019-5.1.2019. The data collection period was defined as one calendar year \u2013 2018 \u2013 but descriptive statistics was also used on the comments added in 2017 to provide a broader insight into the perception of migration by the active readers. All in all, we collected 148 non-anonymous comments in 2018, out of which 3\u20444 were male and 1\u20444 were female. We characterized the active readers as persons involved in the communication process by posting comments to the articles tagged with the \"migrants\" tag and publicly adding unique user comments. The research results also suggest that active readers include men with accentuated negative emotional attitudes towards migrants who express their opinions in the comments on average once in every two news articles tagged with the \"migrants\u201d tag. The most important finding of the study is that a sizable group of active visitors of HNonline.sk perceived migrants very negatively. We also noted a difference in the user reactions between men and women. While women had a greater tendency for impartiality of opinion on the subject, men acted as the proponents of a more articulated and polar opinion on the positive negative scale, with a proclivity to negative opinions. One of the possible explanations is that men (forming the majority of the Hospod\u00e1rske noviny readership) are exposed to the digital media content more frequently, and the media that portray the migrants and refugees significantly negatively and stereotypically (\u0160tefan\u010d\u00edk & Len\u010d, 2012; Mese\u017enikov & B\u00fatorov\u00e1, 2018; \u017d\u00faborov\u00e1 & Bor\u00e1rosov\u00e1, 2016; Hlin\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1, et al., 2014) have a strong impact on \u010clovek a spolo\u010dnos\u0165 [Individual and Society], 2019, Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 43-61. Sentiment analysis of the user comments with the theme of migration posted as interactive content on the Hospod\u00e1rske noviny website 44 the formation of their opinion. The results also show that a significant affirmation of the negative opinion on the subject of migration was observable during the course of the analysis, which is demonstrated by an increasing frequency of negative comments. The number of female comments with a negative sentiment increased by 2.5% in 2018, and the number of male comments with a negative polarity rose up to 15%. Conversely, the number of neutral comments during the analysis period decreased (in males by 17.6% and in females by 1.9% of the total number of analyzed comments). It is also important to note that men contribute to the discussion more often than women, and therefore are more significantly involved in shaping the attitude of the rest of the readers in some way, both in terms of frequency and opinion on a matter. This also indicates that the attitude of male readers of Hospod\u00e1rske noviny is more intense and articulated and therefore potentially more resistant to change. The prevalence of negative comments may impact the perception of migrants by other recipients who show an interest in the views of the active readers of this daily. On the other hand, the active contributors may potentially be affected by the media image of migrants. The study also suggests that the individual impacts should be examined to come to a better understanding of the issue and analyze the causal or correlational nature of these relationships. Overall, the conclusions of our research on the negative perception of Slovak recipients against the migrants and refugees are consistent with other research studies (e.g. Mese\u017enikov & B\u00fatorov\u00e1, 2018; \u017d\u00faborov\u00e1 & Bor\u00e1rosov\u00e1, 2016; Lee & Nerghes, 2018; Sp\u00e1lov\u00e1 & Szabo, 2018) focusing on the research of migration and its perception by specific social and target groups. The present paper suggests that society is facing a difficult task to shape a more favorable attitude of the majority population to migrants for their easier integration into society. The changes in the current state of perception of migrants by the readers will be all the more demanding because of the great impact of active media readers and contributors on the development and shaping of attitudes.", "authors": ["Iveta Bal\u00e1\u017eiov\u00e1"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2019}, "5": {"title": "La percezione della migrazione su Facebook: rappresentazioni e discorsi degli utenti sulla crisi dei rifugiati", "abstract": "My research aims to investigate the role of Facebook users in the construction of the current \u201crefugee crisis\u201d representations.

These pages are one of the main common sources where people read news in their everyday life and they also represent a journalism in transition: in fact, they manifest the continuity between traditional forms of journalismand new ones, but at the same time they also represent a new way of expressing opinions through comments. \nThrough the notion of degradation of the public sphere, the purpose is to critically reflect about the role of comments, trying to delineate a public sphere model that allow to include online participatory forms, which can on one side promote informed citizenry and collective reflection, on the other increase opinion radicalization, polarization and the spread of niche audiences. \nI have chosen a qualitative mixed approach (rather than a quantitative approach with a massive among of data) in order to deepen better discourses, metaphors, images that shape the representation of the migration crisis produced by users through their comments. I have mainly adopted a discursive approach based on discourses\u2019 analysis, \nsometime integrated with features of critical discourse analysis frequently used to study racism discourse in media such as the press (Van Dijk). The most evident outcome of this preliminary exploration is the re-activation of rhetorics and discourses about migration phenomena previously stabilized in traditional media environment: this can be seen as a consequence of the hybrid media system where new media and traditional ones are integrated and influence each other. \nA vast part of public perception is the result of images, political discourses and slogans highly produced by the press and televisions. These results can confirm that the limits of the main patterns of journalistic information about migrations are reproduced in the publicperception showed by users comments. Moreover, the polarization that characterized the media representation of the so called \u201crefugee crisis\u201d is reproduced in the users comments, but the negative side find more space. \nThe interesting point is that this polarization shows a cleargeneralization of the migrant figure based on the denial of individual identity. Migrants have the same collective, ethnics and religious identity. In both sides of the representation, individual past, personal identity, single stories are \nmainly ignored in users comments. The result is the un-personalized people. More in general, the contemporary migration phenomena is perceived as a huge problem to fix or a danger to avoid. Users Comments stabilized and reinforce the idea of migration as an emergency, and not as a structural fact and a normal process in the modern society.", "authors": ["D.

That same year, life science and biomedical researchers published 49 645 English-language articles now referenced in PubMed.Over the intervening years, the number of articles published and referenced in PubMed has grown dramatically, with over 1.2 million referenced in 2018 alone (Figure 1). For any article to have a significant impact and not be lost in the cacophony of academic publications, traditional ways of disseminating the findings of research articles need to evolve. Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, provide new ways for medical journals and researchers to disseminate the findings of published articles to a broader audience than the usual journal-subscriber base. They also are shifting the ways audiences act upon those findings. A 2015 report released from the Congressional Management Foundation, for example, found that as few as 30 social media posts on an issue would force Congressional staffers to \u201cpay attention\u201d to the concern, with 70% of staffers also noting that platforms like Twitter and Facebook made legislators \u201cmore accountable\u201d to their constituents. JAGS began promoting articles via multiple online platforms in 2016 through a targeted social media strategy. In addition to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn posts from the journal accounts, JAGS collaborates with a geriatrics and palliative care podcast (GeriPal.org) and has had articles featured in an online geriatrics journal club (#GeriMedJC). Through the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Health in Aging Foundation, JAGS also helps to produce a series of \u201cpublic education translations\u201d for select research articles. These summaries\u2014written for older adults and caregivers specifically\u2014are posted to the AGS Health in Aging Foundation blog (HealthinAging.org/blog), distributed to health and medicine reporters, and promoted through a mix of JAGS, AGS, and Health in Aging Foundation social media accounts. The aim of this social media strategy is not only to increase awareness of individual publications, but also to increase the impact of individual articles and the journal itself. While it is too early to ascertain the effect of these efforts on traditional measures of impact, including the number of citations or the impact factor of the journal, JAGS has seen a rapid increase in \u201calternative metrics,\u201d or Altmetrics (Figure 2)\u2014a measure of attention for research articles on social media and in news coverage. The web page for each JAGS article includes data pulled directly from Altmetric.com. This service tracks article attention based on online mentions from news outlets, blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Mendeley, Wikipedia, and other sources. Online attention can be swift but fleeting after the publication of an article. This means Altmetric scores tend to accumulate rapidly, complimenting traditional impact metrics based on article citations, whichmay take years to accumulate. Despite all the attention paid to social media, it remains unclear whether social media posts increase dissemination of journal articles, as measured by article views or future citations, with significant conflicting evidence in the literature. This could reflect the observation that not all social media posts are created the same. Simply tweeting the article\u2019s title with no further editorialization may help with awareness that the article was published but does little to leverage what platforms like Twitter and Facebook do best: provide a forum for two-way discussion and dialogue. Indeed, Robinson-Garcia and colleagues published an article brilliantly titled \u201cTheUnbearable Emptiness of Tweeting\u2014About Journal Articles,\u201d which concluded that much of the \u201cpresumably human tweeting was duplicative, almost entirelymechanical and devoid of original thought.\u201d So how should we use these social media platforms in ways that promote knowledge sharing and engagement, while at the same time avoiding propagating monotonousmarketing devoid of any real content? In this issue of JAGS, Lindquist and Ramirez-Zohfeld give an example of one hopeful solution: visual abstracts. Visual abstracts are structured graphical summaries of a study\u2019s key findings. They aremeant to be succinct and visually appealing snapshots of key findings, leveraging visual cues to draw interest regarding the methods and results of an article. Visual abstracts themselves reflect the growing truth that images are among the most useful tools for making social media posts \u201cstandout.\u201d Lindquist and Ramirez-Zohfeld describe their experience of posting a tweet that included a visual abstract vs posting a standard text-only tweet with a link to the article. The visual abstract tweet received nearly seven times as many impressions (or views) and five times as many retweets (a measure of successful engagement on Twitter, based on other users reposting your original message). Unfortunately, the authors could not assess other metrics of reader interest, includingwhether access to the online text changed or if their article saw an uptick in downloads. Research elsewhere, however, suggests the results may be promising. In one prospective case-control crossover DOI: 10.1111/jgs.15859", "authors": ["E. Widera", "Daniel E Trucil", "Alexander K. Smith"], "citations": 1, "venue": "Journal of the American Geriatrics Society", "year": 2019}, "1": {"title": "BJD Medical Student Editors: reaching out to undergraduates in a rapidly evolving world of digital dermatology publishing", "abstract": "Globally, many medical students now aspire to pursue a career in dermatology. The U.K. is no exception \u2013 according to Health Education England, in 2017 dermatology was the most competitive specialty in terms of obtaining a national training number. As a consequence, medical undergraduates are thinking ahead and looking for ways to become involved in the specialty, as early as the first few years of their degree. Medical students have unique needs in the context of dermatology. They are relatively new to a specialty that has been historically under-represented and not taught or assessed uniformly within the undergraduate curriculum. There is a positive correlation between exposure to dermatology as a medical student and self-confidence in managing skin conditions as a junior doctor. Increasing recognition from the British Association of Dermatologists has led to publication of dermatology learning outcomes for medical students. As well as gaining valuable clinical experience in dermatology, students seek opportunities to enhance their CVs and wish to contribute to publication-worthy dermatology articles. To bridge the gap between medical student needs and limited opportunities to publish in dermatology, the BJD appointed its first Medical Student Editor in 2017. A second student joined the team in 2018. The posts are 2 years in length, allowing the second-year post holder to guide the first-year editor, providing near-peer mentorship. Working alongside two BJD Editorial Trainees and the wider editorial team, their role is varied, including contributing to the BJD journal club and Image Gallery and the journal\u2019s social media presence. The first author of every BJD original article is now asked to produce a set of journal club slides. Medical Student Editors are involved in reviewing the slides before publication to ensure high-quality presentations. These slides can then be accessed by BJD users. Many medical schools have their own \u2018DermSoc\u2019 for undergraduates. Critical appraisal is a key skill for every doctor, and DermSoc journal clubs using BJD slides are intended to develop this skill at both an undergraduate and postgraduate level. This initiative also adds value for authors, whose research is more likely to be widely discussed and cited. Looking forward, the aim is for BJD journal club slides to become an essential resource for dermatology journal clubs worldwide. BJD Medical Student Editors also review submissions to the BJD\u2019s Image Gallery, refining captions and ensuring that they accurately and concisely describe the clinical case or research image. Recently, Image Gallery submissions have become interactive by posting on Figure1 (http://www.figure1.com; Twitter: @figure1). Intended for healthcare professionals, medical students included, Figure1 provides a web-based platform to disseminate clinical cases and promote discussion via a linked, moderated forum that adds educational value to the cases. Recent Image Gallery Figure1 posts have received more than 35 000 views each. Along with their peer group, BJD Medical Student Editors have grown up in the digital age; they are adept in the use of social media and play an important role in expanding this facet of the journal\u2019s activity. The BJD regularly shares content via Facebook and Twitter (@BrJDermatol) and recently launched its own YouTube channel. Over 140 uploads of author videos are now available on both the BJD YouTube channel and the new BJD website (http://www.bjd online.com). As part of the BJD Medical Student Editor role, training in critical appraisal is provided by the Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham, in particular from Dr Karen Harman and Professor Kim Thomas. Medical Student Editors attend the BJD editorial team training day, actively contributing to journal development. They also attend the subsequent annual meeting of the British Association of Dermatologists, live tweeting from the event. Creation of BJD Medical Student Editor posts is part of the journal\u2019s commitment to reach out to all of its key stakeholders. The posts ensure representation for the next generation of dermatologists and contribute to their training. The role has proven beneficial to both parties. It offers insight into the world of medical publishing and a chance for post holders to enhance their skills in academic writing, critical appraisal, publication ethics and social media. The journal gains from the insight provided by the student editors into how to connect with the dermatologists of the future, including the added dimension of social media. Reflecting the BJD\u2019s global reach, the U.K.-based undergraduate Medical Student Editors and postgraduate Editorial Trainees will be joined by postgraduate BJD trainees from across the globe. A total of six will be appointed, spread across the continents, and by the time you read this editorial, the first three will be in their posts.", "authors": ["L. Scrivens", "L. Jacquet", "J. Ingram"], "citations": 1, "venue": "The British journal of dermatology", "year": 2019}, "2": {"title": "Talking back, but is anyone listening? Journalism and comment fields", "abstract": "Over the past decade, particularly with the introduction of Web 2.0 technologies, we have seen an increase in the popularity of social media such as forums, weblogs and wikis and social media applications and services such as Facebook and YouTube along with the proliferation of open publishing initiatives and social news websites. This vibrant upsurge of participatory values and practices can be understood as a sign of a general cultural trend whereby audiences increasingly become active media producers. This participatory culture challenges the top-down model of journalism by allowing anyone to post and upload content without formal editorial moderation or filtering processes, while the boundaries between professional journalists and their audience begin to blur as audiences actively increase their control and involvement over their news consumption, becoming both consumers and creators of media content. Citizens are no longer passive receivers but rather are actively engaged in (re)creating, challenging, questioning, correcting, and personalizing news media. As a means of combating revenue loss and reconnecting with their audiences, mainstream news media throughout Western democracies have begun tapping into this digital media culture by increasingly adopting participatory forms of journalism. However, these new forms have yet to be study in any great detail. The empirical research that does exist focuses mostly on gauging the opinions, motives and perceptions of editors/journalists, mapping the current trends and forms, and ethnographic studies on newsroom practices. What is needed to take this body of research further is an analysis of the content. This chapter moves in this direction by addressing the question of whether user-generated content within mainstream news media today is improving the quality journalism, i.e. enhancing the public sphere. One of the most popular forms of user-generated content within mainstream news media is comment fields attached to news articles. Such spaces provide citizens the opportunity to react, debate, and comment on articles (or blogs) written by journalists. The focus of this chapter is on how people are engaging in these spaces. The aim is two fold. First, it is to see to what extent such spaces are facilitating deliberative communicative practices crucial to the public sphere. Are comment fields opening up spaces for citizen deliberation? Second, it is to see whether this type of user-generated content is improving the quality of journalism. Are citizens bringing new ideas, perspectives, facts, and sources to journalistic content? In order to address these questions, postings from comment fields were examined and assessed within the British online newspaper the Guardian. The sample consisted of 3,169 postings (comments) taken from all those articles/blogs (by Guardian journalists) on the UN Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen during a two week period in December 2009. A case study design with normative and descriptive characteristics was utilized. A content analysis was employed as the primary instrument for examination. The coding scheme focused first on gauging the type and level of interaction. Are participants engaging with the content, journalist, or fellow participants, and are such spaces hosting critical-reciprocal exchange between participants? Second, the analysis identified the purpose of the postings; i.e. are participants providing an opinion/argument, posing a question, providing information, calling for action, and/or degrading or acknowledging another? Finally, the analysis focused on the level to which such spaces bring new and alternative opinions, arguments, facts, and sources to the article, to journalism.", "authors": ["Todd Graham"], "citations": 24, "venue": "", "year": 2012}, "3": {"title": "Inbox", "abstract": "articles and your efforts are worth appreciating.

Experts in writing and editing advise selecting the journal at the start of manuscript writing, so that the article can be addressed to the audience of the chosen journal and presented in a general style and length preferred by that journal, thereby helping to avoid unnecessary rejections and delays with publication of the research data and opinion pieces that may advance science. For authors from mainstream science countries, the choice is often determined by the institutional policies, regulations of research funding agencies and knowledge of journal rankings. In fact, scholarly publications are now valued as a hard currency for academic promotion and for enhancing the position of the leading academic and research institutions in prestigious world rankings. \n \nThe emerging scientific powers are also increasingly concerned with what and where their scientists publish, trying to incentivise publications in high-impact journals. However, not all good works find their home in these journals, posing a dilemma - which of the lower rank journals would be suitable for submission. \n \nOver the past few years the global publications boom and uncontrolled growth in the number of journals offering rapid publication and different models of open access have created new sorts of problem, complicating the authors' choices further and diminishing the value of their papers which appear in journals with 'soft' quality controls and poor editorial practices. The manuscripts of 'desperate' authors, which fail to pass the rigorous peer review in established journals and are subsequently submitted to non-selective journals with commercial interests, shake the good traditions of scholarly publishing. And it seems that the problem lies not just with inappropriate choices of novice authors but, to a large extent, with changes in the seasoned authors' preferences (Table 1). \n \n \n \nTable 1 \n \nMain factors affecting the authors' choices of target journals \n \n \n \nThe latest widely circulated global opinion poll, of around one thousand academics, indicates that peer review and other quality factors are no longer the main determinants of submission choice (1). Instead, relevance of research field (24%), impact factor (22%) and indexation (15%) are the top three factors pointed to by most seasoned authors. Interestingly, open access (7%) and publication fees (6%) appeared to be the least important factors. \n \nOther than this opinion poll, a few surveys have analysed authors' preferences for the most suitable journals, with evidence being produced primarily for biomedicine. In 1992, the general medical faculty of Stanford University (n = 305) were asked to rank factors affecting their submission choices (2). The results distinguished the journal's prestige, readership, relevance of the published topics, acceptance rate, print circulation, manuscript turnaround time, the editors' and reviewers' characteristics as the main determinants of initial submissions. For subsequent submission after a rejection, however, the acceptance rate was ranked as the most important factor. Unsurprisingly, other recent surveys have indicated that the current active authors consider the journal impact factor as the crucial player in the field (3, 4), and that no alternative impact indicator has yet gained a comparable rank (4). \n \nThe 'obsession' with high-impact journals is a phenomenon of the 'big science' era, and it reflects the authors' wish to publish their best papers in widely visible and well cited media. As a consequence of 'the impact factor game', it has become a common practice to initially target journals with high impact factors and, in case of rejections, embark on the lower rank journals. This practice overburdens the editors and reviewers, delays publication of potentially valuable works and frustrates the authors, to name just a few pitfalls. Knowledge of the annually updated journal rankings, based on the Web of Science (WoS) and the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) data, may help the authors choose the right journal, especially when a combination of impact indicators over several years is analysed. It is particularly helpful to familiarise the authors with the rankings in their subject categories and closely related fields of science. By complementing the JCR data with alternative, and particularly Scopus-based metrics such as the journal h index and SCImago Journal Rank (SJR), the authors may make better choices when matching journals to the 'quality' of their papers (5). \n \nJournal publishers and editors are in a good position to guide authors by displaying a variety of impact indicators on their journals' websites. The latter is particularly in line with the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (6), which has been signed by 155 journal editors and academics and 82 research institutions, funding bodies and associations, including the European Association of Science Editors (EASE). Earlier EASE published a statement discouraging the reliance on impact factor as a proxy of the quality of individual papers (7). \n \nIt should be stressed that the Web of Science database is a hub for around 12,000 successful journals. There are however many more journals indexed by other bibliographic databases, including specialised ones, serving the purpose of publishing-distributing validated information of interest to a specific community of readers (8). In the era of digitisation any good paper published in a national or a small professional journal can reach its readership by basic visibility on research platforms and search engines such as Google Scholar. This is particularly important to realise for authors, research managers and funding agencies of small and national scientific communities, where the impact factor game keeps a large proportion of good papers away from national journals and sometimes distracts attention from topics of national importance (9, 10). Perhaps the only viable solution for publishers and editors of small national journals, trying to attract quality papers, is to expand the international reach of their journals (10). \n \nAuthors who wish to reach wider readership and rapidly distribute results of their studies such as large trials may target open-access journals. The open access model is relatively new to a publishing market, which entails a range of publication charges. An increasing number of traditional journals have switched to different models of open access, with immediate or delayed archiving in digital libraries such as PubMed Central. Though some research funders mandate and pay for open access, not all individual authors have such funding and therefore choose journals discounting or waiving open access fees. Fortunately, there are currently many journals of professional and national communities operating an open access model without charging their authors. The author pays model is seen by most as a disincentive for choosing a journal (11). When authors are asked to choose between open and traditional access, they need to decide whether the open access brings any added benefit. Actually, not all scholarly papers may have improved citation chances with the open access (eg letters, case reports, brief communications, articles in small professional and national journals). Moreover, available evidence suggests that open access has not gained an advantage over the traditional subscription model in terms of citations (12), and that the overall publishing quality is more important than simply increased exposure to readership (11). \n \nThe attention of the networking media and press to a journal is gaining worldwide popularity. Currently, any large trial, cohort study or review in a high-rank journal attracts comments, which are being posted on the websites and are published in newspapers. For example, the BMJ frequently posts such comments on their blog and takes selected ones for publication as the journal letters. An increasing number of journals, aiming to reach wider audience, encourage posting of papers on individual, institutional and specialised repositories such as ResearchGate and promoting the contents on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Though the efficiency of such promotion has not been widely assessed, it seems to be an ethical option for building up awareness of the journal and for attracting authors, who may cite and submit their own papers to the journal. \n \nTo sum up, a variety of factors that influence the authors' choices have emerged in the past few years. A prime concern for current authors is whether the publication options offer good chances for citations, which are crucially important for academic competitiveness. The citations are equally important for the journals, who are struggling to improve and maintain their ranks (13, 14). What may suffer as a consequence of the global competition is quality, thereby demanding a more comprehensive approach to the avenue of publication and its promotion.", "authors": ["A.

EFFECTS ON MOOD, SELF-ESTEEM AND MOTIVATION 3 Effects of self-photographs on viewer\u2019s mood, self-esteem and motivation In today\u2019s society and world of social media, individuals are constantly posting photographs of themselves, also known as \u201cselfies\u201d. A \u201cselfie\u201d is defined as a photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically captured with a smartphone or webcam and shared via social media (Oiu, Lu, Yang, Ou & Zhu, 2015). The word selfie has just recently come to light over the past decade, and was even named word of the year in 2013 by the Oxford English Dictionary (Qiu et al., 2015). The selfie is a phenomenon that has skyrocketed within the past couple years and has become a regular occurrence for multiple people throughout the world. Research shows that from 2004 to 2012 alone, the amount of selfies taken and posted to social media sites had increased by 17,000% (Barry et al., 2015). This dramatic increase is enough to make social psychologists question what exactly the implications are of this new found era of taking selfphotographs and posting them online to social medias such as Instagram and Facebook for the world to view and have access to. The majority of the world has access to the Internet, which means virtually everyone and anyone has the ability to view selfies of other people at any point in time. Millions of individuals have Facebook and Instagram accounts, and as a result of that, are exposed to selfies essentially every time they log into their accounts. The potential for negative effects on an individual\u2019s emotional well-being, including mood, self-esteem, and motivation may exist, and in a society where we place emphasis on doing our best to take care of ourselves, it is important to figure out what these effects may entail. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of viewing different types of selfie photos on individual\u2019s self-esteem, mood and motivation and how this might be moderated by individual difference factors. EFFECTS ON MOOD, SELF-ESTEEM AND MOTIVATION 4 Psychology of Selfies Unfortunately, very little research has been done in the area of self-photographs, considering it is a fairly new phenomenon that has only recently come to researcher\u2019s attention within the past decade. Barry and colleagues conducted one reliable and relatively recent study in 2015, which looked at the effects that posting self-photographs had on the individual who was posting them to their social media accounts. The researchers involved in this study followed and examined participants\u2019 Instagram accounts, recording which percentage of their photos posted consisted of self-photographs (Barry et al., 2015). Participants completed the Rosenberg SelfEsteem scale and the Narcissism Measurement scale. Results showed that the individuals who posted more self-photographs compared to any other type of photograph on their Instagram accounts tended to have the lowest levels of self-esteem (Barry et al., 2015). These individuals also tended to score higher on the Hiding the Self-level of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (Barry et al., 2015). This study indicated that individuals who post more self-photographs on social media are more likely to have a lower level of self-esteem in comparison with those who do not post self-photographs frequently, however, direction of causation is unclear. The individuals who are posting more self-photographs may have a lower self-esteem already, and as a result post more self-photographs. On the other hand, it may be the frequent posting of selfphotographs that leads to a lower self-esteem. Further research to determine causation is needed in the area of posting self-photographs. Previous research also indicates that there are personality and gender factors to consider when analyzing the effects of self-photographs. Sorokowski and colleagues recently conducted a study that looked at the associations between narcissism, gender and self-photographs (Sorokowski et al., 2015). The research found a strong association between narcissistic EFFECTS ON MOOD, SELF-ESTEEM AND MOTIVATION 5 personality types and the likelihood to post more selfies and this finding was significantly prevalent regarding male participants (Sorokowski et al., 2015). Narcissistic females compared with non-narcissistic females nearly had no difference in regards to the amount of selfphotographs that were taken and posted to social media sites (Sorokowski et al., 2015). Also, it was found that participants who ranked high on a narcissistic personality scale were less likely to engage in social media networking to view other profiles, and more-so to just post about their own personal lives (Sorokowski et al., 2015). These gender differences are important to recognize and be aware of when continuing research into the selfie affect phenomenon. The above results indicate that the posting side of the \u201cselfie spectrum\u201d can have a potential negative affect on an individual\u2019s overall well-being, so it is important to now also look at the viewer\u2019s side of the spectrum, as the present study aimed to do. It is also important to see how different types of selfies affect behaviour, in particular those involving pro-social behaviour. Pro-Social Behaviour and Motivation Research on engaging in and observing pro-social behaviour has also been shown to affect behaviour and well-being. Weinstein and Ryan (2010) did not look into the implications of self-photographs, but rather looked at the affects that pro-social behaviour has on the person committing the pro-social act, the person receiving the pro-social act, and any possible witnesses to the pro-social act (Weinstein & Ryan, 2010). This study included a dictator game in which participants were given \u201cmoney\u201d with the potential option of being able to donate it. Participants were divided into four groups: One group was the \u201cno choice\u201d group that didn\u2019t view an act of pro-social behaviour, one was a \u201cno choice\u201d group that did view an act of pro-social behaviour, one was a choice group given a free will option to donate some of their money, and one group EFFECTS ON MOOD, SELF-ESTEEM AND MOTIVATION 6 was a choice group with a confederate who would \u201cchoose\u201d to donate a large sum of money that everyone else in the group would be witness to (Weinstein & Ryan, 2010). Results showed that participants in the group without the confederate donated significantly less than the participants in the group with the confederate who chose to donate the majority of the money given (Weinstein & Ryan, 2010). Moreover, when participants filled out self-esteem measures, wellbeing measures, and basic psychological need measures, participants who donated more in the confederate group tended to rank much higher on the scales than those who donated less, and those who did not have a choice to donate money but watched the other groups donate money had higher rankings than the no-choice group that didn\u2019t witness any pro-social acts (Weinstein & Ryan, 2010). These results support the notion that not only does pro-social behaviour make the person engaging in it feel better, as well motivate others to contribute to the pro-social behaviour, but this action also increases the well-being of any individual exposed to the prosocial behaviour. If individuals are exposed to self-photographs of people helping other people, it could possibly increase self-esteem levels and evoke feelings of inspiration and motivation. Ideally, individuals are likely to keep their social networking profiles associated with other people that they know on at least some type of personal level. Barry & Wentzel conducted a pro-social behaviour study in 2006 that examined the relationship between friendships and prosocial behaviour motivation through social learning theory. The study emphasized how individuals learn how to behave through social learning \u2013 in other words, observing and imitating our peers, family and other various role models (Barry & Wentzel, 2006). Specifically, this study examined how within close friendships, if one friend continuously engages in prosocial behaviour, eventually that behaviour motivates the observing friend to behave in a similar manner (Barry & Wentzel, 2006). They found significant results, and nearly every time a friend EFFECTS ON MOOD, SELF-ESTEEM AND MOTIVATION 7 engaged in a pro-social behaviour, the second friend almost always followed suit by engaging in a pro-social behaviour of their own (Barry & Wentzel, 2006). This supports the idea that individuals who are exposed to pro-social behaviour photographs will be more motivated to engage in pro-social behaviour themselves, and as a result will have a higher mood and selfesteem. However, comparing themselves to others can also motivate people. Social Comparison and Motivation A 2015 journal article by Suler examined how many people fe", "authors": ["S. Campbell"], "citations": 1, "venue": "", "year": 2016}, "7": {"title": "A Pinch of This and Salt to Taste: An Iterative Approach to Social Media", "abstract": "The American Heritage Center (AHC) formed a Web 2.0 Task Force beginning in April 2009 to develop a social networking strategy and implementation plan. Two years later, the AHC has a blog, a Facebook page, and a Twitter account. After a year and a half of engagement with these utilities, we have accumulated a small online following, gathered data about the kinds of content preferred by our users, and identified areas for future experimentation and growth. This case study will describe our strategic planning process, discuss the transition from concept development to implementation, and highlight how assessment has informed the AHC\u2019s plans for growing its Web 2.0 presence. Archives and libraries have increasingly adopted social networking tools as a part of their outreach strategy, and the American Heritage Center (AHC) at the University of Wyoming (UW) has been one of many repositories experimenting with this recent form of communication. In April of 2009, the AHC convened a task force to explore the ways in which social media channels could be used to enhance the repository\u2019s mission. The task force began by investigating models of strategic engagement with social media and then proceeded to look at individual utilities, along with other repositories\u2019 approaches to their use. It evaluated You Tube, RSS feeds, Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, blogs, and wikis on the basis of popularity, usability, resource requirements, and potential return on investment. Task force members queried other repositories with established social media presences about how and why they chose to invest in the utilities they did. Based upon the results of these analyses, the task force recommended the creation of AHC Facebook and Twitter pages, as well as a blog. It also recommended that members of the arrangement and description unit begin to edit Wikipedia entries related to the collections that they processed. However, for the purpose of this article, we\u2019ll focus primarily on the AHC\u2019s use of Facebook, Twitter, and a blog hosted by Wordpress. The implementation of the three main prongs of our social media strategy began as a trial. The blog (http://americanheritagecenter.wordpress.com/) was intended to publicize AHC operations, collections, and events. The Twitter account (http://twitter.com/#!/AHCnews) referred people to the blog and any other new online content related to the AHC, such as new digital collections, online exhibits, online finding aids and subject guides. The AHC Facebook account (https://www.facebook.com/UWAHC) publicized events, newly donated collections, new finding aids and exhibits. It also provided a platform for communicating basic information about the AHC, such as hours of operation, contact information, and links to the main website. The goals for the trial echoed many of the themes described in the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s 2009 Web and New Media Strategy, namely that the utilities enhance the AHC\u2019s mission-central communications, that they maximize \u201cone-to-many\u201d transmission of knowledge, that they attract larger audiences than the AHC could reach in person, that the tools contextualize and market AHC resources for users, and that the implementation model would allow for further innovation and change. The overlapping content posted to the blog, Facebook page, and Twitter feed allow us to identify the most effective platform for communicating different kinds of information. The simple analytics built into each utility give us feedback about the impact of individual posts. Further, the interlocking nature of this communications strategy multiplies the impact that any announcement might have on our users. We repurpose content from both newly completed and legacy finding aids as blog posts, raising awareness of collections related to popular research topics. We also repost articles written for AHC publications and press releases sent to media outlets. Using repurposed content makes regular posting sustainable. This technique insures that our users are provided with a steady stream of information, while building in time for us to create, edit, enhance and upload new pieces. A separate challenge that the AHC encounters with its social networking strategy is the difficulty of crafting a communication brand\u2014a range of specific messages that promotes and highlights the AHC\u2019s collections, services, and mission that also invites meaningful participation from our audiences. For example, many of our blog and Facebook updates announce newly processed collections, new finding aids, or new donations to the collections. Other updates might publicize a public lecture or exhibit. The style of these posts is \u201cbroadcast\u201d in nature; they do not intrinsically invite engagement or discussion from our online audiences. While an important part of our social networking strategy is disseminating useful information and \u201cstaying on-message,\u201d one of the obstacles in moving forward with our social media operations will be crafting meaningful content that promotes feedback from and engagement with our users. Feedback and assessment are areas that the AHC encounters complications that shape our social networking approach, currently and in the future, as we gather more information about how our users are reaching us. Due to the dispersed and shared management of many of the web tools used to manage AHC collections and service delivery, tracking the online traffic patterns on some sites is simply not possible. The challenges involved with determining whether our social networking strategies impact information-seeking behaviors of our end users are myriad. Nonetheless, the assessment that we are able to conduct reveals that we are attracting users to our digital collections through our Facebook presence. Facebook sent 1,054 users to our digital collections portal from November 2010-November 2011; 267 users accessed the digital portal through the AHC blog. Over 1,300 users found their way to our digital collections from our blog and Facebook updates; these are, presumably, users that we may not have had an opportunity to reach through other means. But compare this with the 11,340 users who found our digital collections through Google. This sheds some light on how both researchers and casual users first approach their research queries and we can then use this behavior to inform our strategy. For example, in several instances, including a post that announced the digitization of the Charles Belden photographs, our AHC blog posts received more traffic than the official access points (University of Wyoming Libraries catalog and the Rocky Mountain Online Archives (RMOA)) because these links were higher-ranked Google search results. Participation in social networking channels has given the AHC the opportunity to explore new modes of communication with current and potential users of our collections and services. In the initial year and a half in which the AHC has maintained an active online presence, we\u2019ve seen the potential that social media hold for both information broadcast and engagement. We at the AHC look forward to exploring the possibilities for future engagement with our fans, followers, and researchers. However, our iterative approach requires assessment throughout the process, as well as a scalable, sustainable model so that our strategy can grow and evolve as the social media landscape shifts and morphs into new modes of interaction. The iterative approach we\u2019ve chosen means that we are always working to perfect our recipe for a successful social networking strategy that blends the complementary ingredients of engagement, branding, and assessment Shannon Bowen-Maier is Associate Archivist, and Rachael Dreyer is Assistant Archivist, at the American Heritage Center, University of Wyoming, Laramie,Wyoming.", "authors": ["Shannon Bowen-Maier", "R. Dreyer"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2011}, "8": {"title": "Dark", "abstract": "This issue of M/C Journal rejects the association of darkness with immorality. In digital communication, the possibilities of darkness are greater than simple fears of what is hidden in online networks. Instead, new work in an emerging field of \u201cdark social\u201d studies\u2019 consider \u201cdark\u201d as holding the potential for autonomy away from the digital visibilities that pervade economic, political, and surveillance logics of the present age. We shall not be afraid of the dark.\nWe start from a technical rather than moral definition of darkness (Gehl), a definition that conceives of dark spaces as having legitimacies and anonymities against structural surveillance. At the same time, breaking away from techno-centric critiques of the dark allows a humanisation of how dark is embodied and performed at individual and structural levels. Other readings of digitally mediated dark (Fisher and Bolter) suggest tensions between exploitative potentials and deep societal reflection, and the ability for a new dark age (Bridle) to allow us to explore unknown potentials. Together these perspectives allow our authors a way to use dark to question and upend the unresting pressure and acceptance of\u2014and hierarchy given to\u2014the light in aesthetics of power and social transformation.\u00a0\nWhile we reject, however, the reduction of \u201cdark\u201d to \u201cimmoral\u201d as we are not blind to \u201cbad actors\u201d lurking in hidden spaces (see Potter, forthcoming). Dark algorithms and their encoded biases shape our online lives. Not everyone has the ability to go off grid or create their own dark networks. Colonial settlerism often hides its brutal logics behind discourses of welfare. And some of us are forced to go dark against our will, as in the case of economies or nations being shut out of communication networks. But above all, the tensions produced in darkness, going dark, and acting dark show the normative powers beyond only focusing on the light.\u00a0\nTaken as a whole, the articles in this issue explore the tensions between dark and connected, opting in and opting out, and exposure and retreat. They challenge binaries that reduce our vision to the monochromaticism of dark and light. They explain how the concept of \u201cdark\u201d expands opportunities for existence and persistence beyond datafication. They point to moral, ethical, and pragmatic responses of selves and communities seeking to be/belong in/of the dark.\u00a0\nThe issue starts with a high-stakes contest: what happens when an entire country is forced to go dark? While the articles in this issue were in review, Australian Facebook users were abruptly introduced to a unique form of darkness when, overnight, all news posts were removed from Facebook. Leaver\u2019s feature article responds to tell the story of how Facebook and Google fought the Australian media law, and nobody won. Simply put, the platforms-cum-infrastructures did not want the government to mandate terms of their payments and business to traditional news organisations, so pulled the plug on Australia. As Leaver points out, Facebook\u2019s cull not only made news media go dark, but in the midst of a pandemic and ongoing bushfires, prevented government agencies from posting and sharing government public health information, weather and wind patterns, and some State Emergency Services information.\u00a0\nHis article positions darkness on the spectrum from visibility to invisibility and focuses on the complex interplays of who is in control of, or has the power over, visibility. Facebook\u2019s power to darken vital voices in society was unprecedented in Australia, a form of \u201cde-platforming at scale\u201d (Crawford). It seemed that Facebook (and as Leaver explains, Google, to a lesser extent) were using Australia to test platform power and legislative response. The results of this experiment, Leaver argues, was not a dawn of a new dark age\u2014without the misinforming-glare of Facebook (see Cinque in this issue)\u2014but confirmatory evidence of the political economy of national media: News Corp and other large traditional media companies received millions from Facebook and Google in exchange for the latter being exempt from the very law in question. Everyone won, except the Australians looking to experiment and explore alternatives in a new darkness. Scared of the dark, politicians accepted a mutually agreed transfer of ad-revenue from Google and Facebook to large and incumbent media organisations; and with that, hope of exploring a world mediated without the glare of digital incumbents was snuffed out. These agreements, of course, found user privacy, algorithmic biases, and other concerns of computational light out of scope.\nPlaying off the themes of status quo of institutionalised social media companies, Cinque examines how social online spaces (SOS) which are governed by logics of surveillance and datafication embodied in the concept of the \u201cgazing elite\u201d (data aggregators including social media), can prompt anxieties for users regarding data privacy. Her work in the issue particularly observes that anxiety for many users is shaped by this manifestation of the \u201cdark\u201d as it relates to the hidden processes of data capture and processing by the mainstream platforms, surveillant digital objects that are incorporated into the Internet of Things, and \u201cdark\u201d or black boxed automated decisions which censor expression and self-representation. Against this way of conceptualising digital darkness, Cinque argues that dark SOS which use VPNs or the Tor browser to evade monitoring are valuable to users precisely because of their ability to evade the politics of visibility and resist the power of the gazing elite.\nContinuing away from the ubiquitous and all consuming blue glow of Facebook to more esoteric online communities, Maddox and Heemsbergen use their article to expand a critique on the normative computational logics which define the current information age (based on datafication, tracking, prediction, and surveillance of human socialities). They consider how \u201cdigging in the shadows\u201d and \u201ctinkering\u201d with cryptocurrencies in the \u201cdark\u201d is shaping alternative futures based on social, equitable, and reciprocal relations. Their work traces cryptocurrencies\u2014a \u201ccommunity generated technology\u201d made by makers, miners and traders on darknets\u2014from its emergence during a time of global economic upheaval, uncertainty and mistrust in centralised financial systems, through to new generations of cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin that, based on lessons from early cryptocurrencies, are mutating and becoming absorbed into larger economic structures. These themes are explored using an innovative analytical framework considering the \u201cconstruction, disruption, contention, redirection, and finally absorption of emerging techno-potentials into larger structures\u201d. The authors conclude by arguing that experiments in the dark don\u2019t stay in the dark, but are radical potentials that impact and shape larger social forms.\nBradfield and Fredericks take a step back from a focus on potentially arcane online cultures to position dark in an explicit provocation to settler politics\u2019 fears and anxieties. They show how being dark in Australia is embodied and everyday. In doing so, they draw back the veil on the uncontested normality of fear of the dark-as-object. Their article\u2019s examples offer a stark demonstration of how for Indigenous peoples, associations of \u201cdark\u201d fear and danger are built into the structural mechanisms that shape and maintain colonial understandings of Indigenous peoples and their bodies as part of larger power structures. They note activist practices that provoke settlers to confront individuals, communities, and politics that proclaim \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the Dark\u201d (see Cotes in Bradfield and Fredericks).\nDrawing on a related embodied refusal of poorly situated connotations of the dark, Hardley considers the embodied ways mobile media have been deployed in the urban night and observes that in darkness, and the night, while vision is obscured and other senses are heightened we also encounter enmeshed cultural relationships of darkness and danger. Drawing on the postphenomenological concept of multistability, Hardley frames engagement with mobile media as a particular kind of body-technology relation in which the same technology can be used by different people in multiple ways, as people assign different meanings to the technology. Presenting empirical research on participants\u2019 night-time mobile media practices, Hardley analyses how users co-opt mobile media functionalities to manage their embodied experiences of the dark. The article highlights how mobile media practices of privacy and isolation in urban spaces can be impacted by geographical location and urban darkness, and are also distinctly gendered.\u00a0\nSmith explores how conversations flow across social media platforms and messaging technologies and in and out of sight across the public domain. Darkness is the backstage where backchannel conversations take place outside of public view, in private and parochial spaces, and in the shadow spaces where communication crosses between platforms. This narrative threading view of conversation, which Smith frames as a multiplatform accomplishment, responds to the question held by so many researchers and people trying to interpret what people say in public on social media. Is what we see the tip of an iceberg or just a small blip in the ocean? From Smith\u2019s work we can see that so much happens in the dark, beyond the gaze of the onlooker, where conversational practices move by their own logic. Smith argues that drawing on pre-digital conversational analysis techniques associated with ethnomethodology will illuminate the social logics that structure online interaction and increase our understanding of online sociality forces.\nSet in the context of merging platforms and the \u201crise of data\u201d, Lee presents issues that undergird contemporary, globally connected media systems.\u00a0 In translating descriptions of complex systems, the article criti", "authors": [], "citations": 0, "venue": "M/C Journal", "year": null}, "9": {"title": "Coronavirus misinformation: quantifying sources and themes in the COVID-19 \u2018infodemic\u2019 (Preprint)", "abstract": "\n BACKGROUND\n The COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded alongside what the Director-General of the World Health Organization has termed an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of misinformation . In their coverage of the pandemic, traditional media outlets have reported and sometimes amplified the voices of various actors across the political spectrum who have advocated unproven cures, denied what is known scientifically about the nature and origins of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and proposed conspiracy theories which purport to explain causation and often allege nefarious intent. These competing narratives and explanations have risen and fallen rapidly, behaving almost as viral phenomena themselves. \n\nMisinformation about COVID-19 is a serious threat to global public health. If people are misled by unsubstantiated claims about the nature and treatment of the disease, they are less likely to observe official health advice and may thus contribute to the spread of the pandemic and pose a danger to themselves and others. Health protection strategies such as hygiene, sanitation, social distancing, mask wearing, lockdowns, and other measures will be less effective if distrust of public health authorities becomes sufficiently widespread to substantially affect public behavior. Specifically, misinformation about treatments for COVID disease can prompt people to attempt cures that might harm them, while fears and distrust about a possible vaccine could undermine the uptake of any vaccination campaign aiming to immunize the public at a later date. \n\nBoth misinformation and disinformation center on the dissemination of false information, with the difference being that the former is shared without malice while the latter is spread with the intent to deceive. Though we use the term misinformation in this study, it is clear that some of the nine main topics that emerged do include elements of disinformation in that they appear to have been shared intentionally, primarily to advance political agendas, and others are a combination of misinformation and disinformation.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n It is commonly assumed that misinformation is largely a phenomenon of social media, provoking calls for stricter regulation of the content on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. However, misinformation also appears in traditional media. Here it typically takes two forms: amplification of false claims through widespread coverage of prominent persons whose views and comments are considered newsworthy; and to a lesser degree, active fact-checking and debunking of false claims and misinformation. \n\nIn this paper we aim to quantify the extent of the COVID infodemic within traditional media and examine it as a multi-dimensional informational phenomenon. While previous authors have investigated specific types of social media misinformation , including the role of \u201cbots\u201d in its dissemination , to our knowledge our analysis is the first comprehensive survey of the traditional and online media landscape regarding COVID-19 misinformation, encompassing millions of articles published globally within the five-month span that followed the outbreak of the pandemic in January 2020. \n\nOurs is not the first media assessment: the Reuters Institute/Oxford Martin School published a factsheet in April 2020 looking at \u201cTypes, Sources and Claims of COVID-19 Misinformation,\u201d but this considered a sample of only 225 misinformation examples in the media . By using a quantitative approach examining a comprehensive English-language global media database of tens of millions of articles, we aim to present empirical insights into the nature and impact of the entire infodemic that may better inform response measures taken by public health authorities, media institutions, governmental organizations, academia, and others.\n \n \n METHODS\n We performed a comprehensive analysis of media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic using Cision\u2019s Next Generation Communications Cloud platform. This commercial platform aggregates online news (including licensed print and traditional media news content via LexisNexis), blogs, podcasts, TV, and radio, sourced via webcrawlers and third-party content providers. In total, this database encompasses a network of 7 million-plus global sources of print, broadcast, and online news. Cision\u2019s comprehensive coverage and search capabilities make it a potentially powerful tool for the kind of content analysis we perform here. \n\nThis Next Generation Communications Cloud database aggregates global coverage, with the largest volume of English-language results coming in descending order from the United States, United Kingdom, India, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, with African and other Asian nations also represented in the sample. This database was queried using an English-language search string for misinformation topics in the context of COVID-19. The search string included variations on common thematic keywords (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, etc.) and used Boolean operators such as AND, OR, NOT, and proximity terms to sift for relevant content. (For a full reproduction of Boolean operators see Supplementary Information 1.) Media coverage was examined from a sample of articles published between January 1 and May 26, 2020. \n\nMisinformation terms were identified by an iterative cycle of reviewing coverage of COVID-19-related misinformation, creating an initial search string, further reviewing coverage, and adding additional terms to improve inclusiveness. Sites known to produce non-news content, such as wordpress.com and livejournal.com, were excluded. Keyword-based, pre-set content filters for press releases, job postings, earnings and stock news, and other irrelevant categories were applied in order to exclude them from results. \n\nSpecific misinformation topics were identified within media coverage via a similar iterative approach of reviewing sample coverage, search query adjustment, and further review of coverage until it was possible to determine that the leading misinformation narratives over the time period were represented since new topic searches failed to generate a substantial volume of results. Misinformation topics were then searched within the overarching misinformation search, operating as a layering set of context terms. When topic research identified new misinformation keywords, they were added to the master search to further improve comprehensiveness. \n\nThere is obviously a distinction to be made between misinformation per se (defined as information that is likely to mislead the audience) and information that discusses misinformation topics or the phenomenon of the infodemic with the explicit objective of debunking or correcting factual inaccuracies. We explicitly isolate this fact-checking coverage within the broader misinformation sample by identifying common terms used to identify misinformation as false, such as \u201cfact-check\u201d and \u201cfalse claim\u201d, as well as the use of terms like \u201cmisinformation\" and \"conspiracy theory\" which inherently imply that the narratives they reference are untrue. \n\nCoverage falling into the misinformation search was also compared to coverage of COVID-19 generally, which was defined as the misinformation COVID-19 search excluding misinformation context terms. We quantify the extent of misinformation by volume, meaning the number of articles about a topic. To avoid excluding coverage that mentions more than one topic, topics within the report are not mutually exclusive. A notable amount of overlap between certain topics was observed, thus \u201cfrequency\u201d is used to ensure accurate representation of each topic. In this report, \u201cfrequency\u201d is defined as the volume of a specific topic divided by the total volume for the misinformation conversation.\n \n \n RESULTS\n From January 1 to May 26, 2020, English-language traditional media outlets published over 1.1 million individual articles (total 1,116,952) mentioning COVID-19 misinformation. This represented just under 3% of the overall COVID-19 conversation (total 38,713,161 articles) during the same timeframe.\n\nWe identified five different sub-sections within the overall COVID misinformation conversation, summarized in Table 1. (See Supplementary Info for specific search strings that yielded these results.)

This has opened up new opportunities for large scale harassment. In particular, a phenomenon known as zoombombing has emerged, in which aggressors join online meetings with the goal of disrupting them and harassing their participants. In this paper, we conduct the first data-driven analysis of calls for zoombombing attacks on social media. We identify ten popular online meeting tools and extract posts containing meeting invitations to these platforms on a mainstream social network, Twitter, and on a fringe community known for organizing coordinated attacks against online users, 4chan. We then perform manual annotation to identify posts that are calling for zoombombing attacks, and apply thematic analysis to develop a codebook to better characterize the discussion surrounding calls for zoombombing. During the first seven months of 2020, we identify over 200 calls for zoombombing between Twitter and 4chan, and analyze these calls both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our findings indicate that the vast majority of calls for zoombombing are not made by attackers stumbling upon meeting invitations or bruteforcing their meeting ID, but rather by insiders who have legitimate access to these meetings, particularly students in high school and college classes. This has important security implications because it makes common protections against zoombombing, e.g., password protection, ineffective. We also find instances of insiders instructing attackers to adopt the names of legitimate participants in the class to avoid detection, making countermeasures like setting up a waiting room and vetting participants less effective. Based on these observations, we argue that the only effective defense against zoombombing is creating unique join links for each participant.", "authors": ["Chen Ling", "Utkucan Balci", "J.

Social distancing along with other measures implemented to control spread had a drastic impact on the provision of healthcare including deferred elective procedures and surgeries as well as delayed care and evaluation for emergent diagnoses such as heart attacks and strokes. In the home nutrition practice, patients began to delay routine laboratory tests and were canceling or deferring annual visits. Our group soon began to rapidly deploy telehealth to meet the needs of the home nutrition patients. Telehealth is not a new concept with descriptions of healthcare being provided at a distance with the use of telephone in the 1870s. However, widespread adoption has been limited because of regulation (licensure, prescriptions, credentialing, and privileges), lack of reimbursement, as well as adoption and availability of technology needed to carry out telehealth visits. As regulations and limits on reimbursements were waived during COVID-19 pandemic, our home nutrition practice began to evaluate core components of the care we provide for our patients and assess which could be successfully transitioned to telehealth.

To address this, we developed an inpatient training program for newly-graduated nurses designed to provide additional training in critical care, oncology, and BMT to needed to improve continuity of care, patient outcomes, patient satisfaction and reduce costs. Methods, Intervention, & Analysis Purpose To describe the design and preliminary results of a seven-month multispecialty BMT/Critical Care Unit (CCU) Residency Program. Program Description The seven-month residency program was divided in three phases. Phase I began with four months of classroom teaching, online modules, and 300 hours of clinical training in intensive care. During Part II, nurses spent six weeks in oncology learning how to administer chemotherapy/biotherapy and monitor patients with hematologic/oncologic conditions. During Part III, nurses spent eight weeks in BMT learning how to administer conditioning regimens, infuse stem cells, and manage post-transplant complications, as well as attending classroom lectures, reviewing case studies, and completing online modules. Throughout training, progress was measured against competencies issued by ONS, FACT and others. Findings & Interpretation Eighteen novice nurses took part in the initial cohort. During the program, progress was evaluated via collaborative support meetings with management, clinical education, and residents/preceptors determining if expectations were met. Throughout training, feedback was solicited from nurses in order to make modifications for future cohorts. Discussion & Implications Studies show that cross-training in BMT/CCU can improve patient outcomes and enhance continuity of care. Nurses in our residency program received advanced training in pathophysiology, associated interventions, BMT treatment plans, and how to provide safe and effective patient care during changes in acuity. Additional evaluation of program outcomes is underway especially as it pertains to the ability of BMT nurses to manage patients with complex, multispecialty needs.", "authors": ["Annette Caravia", "Karla Ruiz-Tamayo", "Yanet Castro-Bustamante", "M.

Like many others, our hospital system began looking closely at the recommendations for decreasing transmission of COVID-19, chief among them social distancing. By early March, the need for an immediate adaptation of our clinical care delivery system was clear. Within a week, clinics had transitioned from in-person visits to telehealth involving telephone or video. Screening processes for COVID-19 were quickly made available on a free online platform through which at-risk individuals were directed to drivethrough centers for in-person testing. The problem was that many of our patients could not access the online system. In our roles as directors of free clinics, we have become intimately involved with the complexity inherent to the care of underserved populations, including how seemingly innovative programs can sometimes not meet their intended goals. The CARES clinic has a main site and a rural outreach site that treat uninsured adult patients and a pediatric immunization clinic for uninsured and underinsured children. The 529 Meeting Street clinic treats patients at a drop-in resource center serving individuals experiencing housing instability. Levels of literacy, extent of chronic diseases, and complexity of social circumstances for patient populations at both clinics are highly variable. As our main hospital system was transitioning to telehealthbased care, we were rapidly trying to put measures into place at our free clinics that would ensure that our patients did not lose their access to health care. It quickly became apparent that the newly built telehealth systems created additional access hurdles for our free clinic patients, and we would soon learn that pockets existed within the larger population that were impacted by these barriers. As is often the case, those whose access was impeded were the most vulnerable to poor health outcomes related to COVID-19. This was not unique to our community, and in fact it was repeated throughout the country when other hospital systems transitioned to telehealth as a sensible and efficient way to deliver health care while implementing social distancing to combat the spread of COVID-19. Simultaneously, the diminished accessibility to technology based on various societal and social factors, sometimes referred to as the digital gap or digital divide, was being exposed at a critical time in a public health crisis. Frighteningly, there were no measures at the ready to address it. Use of telehealth platforms has been on the rise over the past several years. Telehealth has been lauded as a means to close the healthcare gap to rural populations; however, recent authors have raised the concern that technology may actually be widening the gap between groups both nationally and even globally due to persistent social, economic, and political factors. Taken within the context of several social determinants of health, we can see how the digital divide occurs and can perpetuate inequity based on various social factors (Table 1). In fact, the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) called for it to be included as a social determinant of health in 2017. Regarding the patient populations seen in our free clinics, our first concern was physical access to Internet services, defined largely by built environment factors. Our homeless population lacked reliable Internet access outside of the technology center at the clinic. About a third of those served at the rural CARES clinic site do not have Internet access in their homes. This is not unlike the Federal Communications Commission report in 2018 showing that within the United States, 31% of rural households still lack access to broadband Internet. A combination of technology and in-person services has been found to help address some of this disparity, and in our case, a direct combination of the 2 types of service proved necessary.

HHCI is a peer-reviewed journal that serves as an interdisciplinary forum for the dissemination of information for clinical practice, education, research, and policy on issues concerning Hispanic/Latino populations around the globe. In addition to our commitment to the Hispanic/Latino population, we are committed to doing our best to meet the needs of our reading audience. With this commitment in mind, this editorial reports on the journal\u2019s accomplishments and new features over the past year. During 2019, HHCI saw growth in circulation (i.e., subscriptions). In addition, there was an increase in online usage with full-text downloads up by 16%. The journal enhanced its productivity and number of article submissions during 2019. HHCI is proud to report an efficient full peer-review process: average time to first decision within 1 month of manuscript submission and an average time to final decision within 3 months. HHCI is taking steps to provide its authors with strategies to enhance visibility of their published articles. HHCI now features visual abstracts, which authors can use to share their work on social media platforms. HHCI, via its publisher Sage, partners with Kudos, a service that provides authors with tools to enhance visibility and impact of their work. In direct response to feedback from the readers and subscribers, HHCI began two new series of articles in 2019. In response to a \u201ccall to action\u201d to strengthen the mental health workforce (National Council for Behavioral Health, 2018), HHCI began publishing a series of brief reports focused on mental health topics. In particular, these reports serve to raise awareness among health care providers, educators, researchers, and policy makers about the important issues surrounding the mental health needs of the Hispanic/ Latino population. The series began in the September issue with an article focused on an understudied, and sometimes ignored, problem: Hispanics and suicide. In this December issue, the negative impact of discriminating policies on the mental health of Hispanics is discussed. To address a request by our readers for more resources that can be used to enhance scholarly productivity, HHCI will publish a series of articles focused on scholarship. In this December issue, you will find the first article in the series, which gives \u201ctips\u201d for reviewing the literature and writing literature reviews. Dr. Norma Cuellar, NAHN President, and Editor of the Journal of Transcultural Nursing (https://journals.sagepub. com/home/tcn), authored the article, and I encourage you to read it and share it with your colleagues, as it provides many pearls of helpful information.

The Good School Concept, approved in 2015 and developed in response to the National School Concept (1988), encourages the continuation of this discussion. Educational reform in Lithuania began in 1988 when the National School Concept was introduced, which aimed at fostering a vision of the national and civic school. Based on the Lithuanian educational documents, the General Concept of Education in Lithuania and the Good School Concept (2015) emphasize the close collaboration between family, school, and society. The Good School Concept of 2015 states that \u201cthe good school is a school that aspires towards the foundation of humanistic values to seek the creation of meaning, discovery, and personal success, which, in its activities, is guided by the decisions made by its community members\u201d. This article presents both quantitative and qualitative research. The current study is a part of the wider research \u201cThe Conception of School Community of General Education School Progress in terms of the Good School Concept\u201d. The quantitative research presented in this article takes the form of a questionnaire survey performed in 2018, which involved representatives of general education school management and teachers, as well as grade 7\u201312 gymnasium students and their parents. The qualitative research in this paper is an interview performed in 2018, which involved representatives of general education school management and teachers, as well as grade 7\u201312 gymnasium students and their parents. The following criteria were used in the selection of respondents, who were eligible to be involved if they: held the position of school principal or deputy director for education; worked as a teacher, had at least 2 years of pedagogical work experience at school, and participated in school activities; or were a student, studying according to the programs of grades 7\u20138, grades 9\u201310, or grades 11\u201312, were delegated to the school participating in the study, and had parental consent to participate in the study. With the help of purposeful sampling, comprehensive schools were chosen that each delegated one parent who had a child studying in grades 7\u201312 and who was acquainted with the activities of the school. Qualitative research was chosen as a method because of its association with the social constructivist paradigm, which emphasises the socially constructed nature of reality. The criteria applied for the selection of comprehensive schools meant ensured that they were: from different regions of the country \u2013 to include schools from a city, big town, town, and village; and founded by both state and public institutions. When analyzing the perception of the progress announced by general education schools, it is important to remember that a school is an organization operating in a complex and changing social environment and involving many different social groups, such as school administrators, teachers, students, parents, and other parties. This is based on a pre-existing idea from the Good School Concept (2015): that education in Lithuania is founded on close collaboration between the family, school, and society. This article addresses the scientific problem that the view of the general education school community towards the wider community as an important element in a good school is not sufficiently elucidated. The following problem-based issues are then formulated: What is the concept of community? Which characteristics of the community are important to the members of the general education school community in a good school? How important is the learning community to the members of the school community in a good school? The object of this research is the concept of community in a good school from the perspectives of teachers, students, parents of students, and school administration, in order to meet the concept of a good school. The aim of this research is to reveal the concept of community in a good school from the perspectives of teachers, students, parents of students, and school administration, in meeting the concept of a good school. The research methods used were: analysis of academic literature and educational documents; structured interviews; and questionnaire. To analyze the interview, content analysis was adopted, (Bitinas, Rupsien\u0117, and \u017dyd\u017ei\u016bnait\u0117, 2008) which allowed for the formation of conclusions based on the text analyzed. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the interview data, which allowed for the drawing of conclusions based on the text analyzed. This method of analysis was based on systematic analytical steps: multiple readings of records; and the systematic interpretation of distinguished categories and subcategories and their justification based on the evidence from the transcribed texts \u2013 i.e., the confirmatory statements. According to the qualitative research methodology, the confirmatory statements are extracts from answers provided by the participants which cannot be changed by the researcher; therefore, they are quoted exactly as given by the participants. The initial interview data was handled in such a way as to ensure that it was impossible to identify the persons involved in the study. The research was organized and data analysis was carried out and presented based on the principles of qualitative research ethics: ensuring respect for individual privacy, confidentiality, and anonymity, with goodwill and justice. The statistical analysis of the questionnaire survey was performed using the SPSS Statistics17.0 software. Pearson\u2019s non-parametric chi-squared (\u03c72) test was also applied, which helped to identify the statistical independence of variables. A number of conclusions were thereby reached. The qualitative study revealed that school administration representatives, teachers, students, and parents identified the school community among the traits that revealed a good school, but differed on what constitutes a good community. However, the quantitative survey revealed that school administration and teachers did not name community as one of the five most important signs of a good school. Qualitative research revealed different concepts of community: school administration representatives attributed many features to a community in a good school, but teachers named only the learning community. In the opinion of parents, the community must be involved in discussing and developing school strategy, and students distinguished its cooperative nature as the main feature of the community. The concept of community as understood by school administration representatives perfectly responds to the agreed features of the community mentioned in Lithuanian legal acts and scientific literature \u2013 learning, reflective, focused, cooperative, open, and empathetically caring about the well-being of each member. The concept of community in other school community target groups (teachers, students, and parents of students) in a good school is fragmented.", "authors": ["Gintaut\u0117 \u017dib\u0117nien\u0117"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2021}, "9": {"title": "Investigating Students\u2019 Eyesights in the Utilization of Platforms in Learning ESP During the Covid-19 Pandemic", "abstract": "\u00a0 \nThe Covid-19 pandemic suddenly attacked the world and led every sector of life affected, including the education process, which is forced to shift into online mode.

This research uncovers the students' preference of digital platforms in learning ESP during the Covid-19 pandemic, the factors accepting their preference, and their perception of those learning platforms. The design of this study is qualitative. The participants of this study were 112 freshmen of a state university in Makassar who learn English for Specific Purposes (ESP), comprising 95 females and 17 males. The participants were consisted of 3 majors and involved in remote learning for one semester (16 meetings) through WhatsApp, Google Classroom, University LMS, YouTube, and Video Conference (Zoom and Google Meet). In order to collect the data, a questionnaire that consists of close-ended and open-ended questions was distributed to the participants. It is found that the students' preference of digital platform in learning ESP during the Covid-19 pandemic is WhatsApp. The factors affecting students' preference of the platform are demographic and economic constraints. The criteria of the application that is highly preferred by the students were the one which does not drain the internet quota, can still work correctly in which the internet connection is not strong, and can facilitate the interaction between lecturers and students. Finally, this study suggests that no one perfect digital platform can replace face-to-face learning since many things are missing during this online learning.

This brings the total to 98,232 cases, 2,039 of whom have already died.1 As the Philippines undergoes a new set of quarantine protocols for the first half of August 2020, 60 medical associations have asked for a time-out and sought the national government to revert the Philippine capital, Metro Manila back to a stricter enhanced community quarantine.2 These associations cite two main reasons for their plea for a renewed lockdown. They argue that the healthcare system of the nation\u2019s capital has reached a critical level. Given the \u201cseemingly endless number of patients trooping\u201d to hospitals for emergency care and admission, \u201cthe healthcare system has been overwhelmed\u201d. As a consequence, they say that healthcare workers have been experiencing fatigue and depression as they \u201ccan no longer bear the burden of deciding who lives and who dies\u201d. Recent correspondences in this journal have urged for interventions necessary to deal with the psychological3, emotional4, and spiritual5,6 well-being of the general public at this time of the pandemic. We find, however, that these interventions should be extended to our healthcare frontliners as well. The Philippines\u2019 healthcare workers are a case in point. Besides the lack of personal protective equipment, our frontliners are underpaid and do not get the respect they deserve. They answer \u201cto the call of duty while battling fear and anxiety\u201d.7 Aside from this, they also experience pressure, stress, insomnia, denial, anger, and fear.8 This is of course on top of constant exposure to the virus!

He was talking of the seemingly endless webinars that the pandemic forces us to attend online. I now go to meetings, when I mean I sit in front of a screen. I make sure my top half is spick and span, dressed for the occasion, while my bottom half, out of sight, is something completely different. The new normal is the webinar, where we try to feel part of a team, yet sit alone in an office, study, bedroom, wherever we have decided to make our workspace. When I join my digital colleagues, I may be talking to them, but I am also looking at where they are seated. What\u2019s that on the wall behind? A family photo, a rosette from a dressage competition, or perhaps a fine work of art. Or is my colleague forced to make a brave face as he squats on an upstairs landing, while in the distance I hear his children creating mayhem? In the early stages of the pandemic, I felt that webinars were temporary, that soon we would be back to how it was. Sadly, that is not the case, and for the present, there seems little sign of things improving. There are many who say that online meetings are here to stay, and I agree they have their uses. But there is something missing. Body language for sure, that look in the eye, the reaction to an unexpected statement, little features that may seem unimportant but mean so much. Virtual meetings may have lower cost, less environmental impact, greater and more international attendance, be speedier and be simple to record and distribute. They are also simpler to measure\u2014attendance numbers, time spent online, polling counts and more. Meanwhile face-to-face (F2F) events, which was the way of things 12 months ago, take people to a more focused environment with fewer distractions. There is opportunity for brainstorming, networking and relationship building that the digital world simply cannot offer. For the trade, what better way is there to target your product than to attend a F2F meeting with a large cohort of folk who are genuinely interested in what you can offer? There are obvious costs, as F2F can be expensive\u2014travel, room hire, catering, audiovisual support and so much more [1]. But I do miss the body language, which has helped me reach decisions for many years. These days all I see is a face, and on a computer screen that is hard to interpret. A smile suggests either approval or happiness. A frown can be the opposite [2]. The most trustworthy facial expression is a slight raise of the eyebrows with an added smile, something that conveys friendliness and confidence [3]. Narrower faces and prominent noses are said to reflect high intelligence and people who are smiling are reported to be cleverer [4]. Rapid blinking shows distress or discomfort while infrequent blinking suggests that a person is trying to control their eye movements [5]. In pre-pandemic days, if someone looked at me while either of us was talking, I felt I had their attention. Breaking eye contact suggested that they were distracted, uncomfortable or trying to conceal their feelings [6]. Yet I am now frequently addressed by a colleague who is looking anywhere but at me. My image may be somewhere on their screen, and they may be looking at my image as they talk, but they are not looking at me. Body movements and posture have now gone, as have touch, personal space and tiny gestures. Each is a different type of non-verbal communication [7]. I am left largely with the tone of voice, which is often fuzzy thanks to poor reception. How I crave the day when this so-called new normal of digital communication settles down and F2F is re-established. Turning to our journal, this journal, JHPS, I was more than excited by the last issue, number 7.2. It took ages to be published, I was told thanks to Covid-19, but once it had appeared, its content was tremendous.

As \u2018surges\u2019 in infections hit a community, medical services risk being swamped, and \u2018elective\u2019 services are appropriately curtailed; sometimes in response to governmental or institutional mandates. For gastroenterology, this has meant the cancellation of all but emergency endoscopy and a move from inperson clinic visits to some form of virtual engagement with the patient, such as a video visit or telephone consultation. This, as recently detailed by Holtmann et al. [1], is the \u2018emergency phase\u2019 which has been of variable duration in different locations, typically lasting weeks or, at most, a few months. Most of us are now in the \u2018adaptation phase\u2019 were we learn to live with and optimize a variety of models of service delivery in an attempt to return to normal (or, as many have termed it, the \u2018new normal\u2019). How we handle this and how our patients adapt to new models of doctor\u2013patient interaction are of critical importance for the management of the non-COVID illnesses which dominate our practices. Several factors conspire to hamper a return to normal. First, protocols related to patient and staff safety can result in a prolongation of turn-around times in clinics and endoscopy suites and, thereby, reduce the number of procedures that can be completed in any given day. Thankfully, a number of gastroenterological societies have produced guidance on the resumption of endoscopy services in the era of COVID (the following are two examples: https://www.asge.org/docs/default-source/defaultdocument-library/asge-guidance-for-reopeningl_ 4-28-2020.pdf and https://webfiles.gi.org/docs/ policy/2020resuming-endoscopy-fin-05122020.pdf). As we all learn to adapt to this new environment, it is to be hoped that more cases can be accommodated. Second,and less tangible, is a palpable fear amongour patients of contact with a hospital or any medical facility. Given all the protocols enforced at our hospitals, clinics and endoscopy centers to minimize the risk of transmission of a coronavirus, I would argue that these facilities, are perhaps, among the safest.", "authors": ["E.

Less than 6 months later, the COVID-19 pandemic had caused a widespread global disruption with a huge impact on business and transportation, and compromising every aspect of daily life. Total lockdowns, partial lockdowns and \u2018intelligent\u2019 lockdowns for some time dominated our way of life and fuelled widespread turmoil. Healthcare services and especially surgery have been partly or completely disrupted. Planned treatments had to be cancelled, and operative capacity was reduced because health workers have been reassigned to support the COVID-19 services. There was a shortage of diagnostics, medicine and protective material even in the countries with the best healthcare systems globally. We swiftly had to convert from face-to-face meetings to webinars and endless Zoom and team meetings, from in-person consultation to telephone and video consultation. Travelling was completely restricted forcing airlines to operate at 20% of normal in April 2020, with over half of the combined, global fleet grounded. Fortunately, the travel restrictions in Europe are lifted for most countries at this moment, but travel outside of Europe is still banned forcing our national airline KLM to operate on only one third of its capacity. It will be some time before we know what the true impact will be on health care and our daily living. It is difficult to foresee how COVID-19 will behave in the near future\u2014whether there will be a second wave and how severe the wave will be. Although numbers are on the rise again, hospital admissions are still lagging behind probably because more young people are affected. We still do not know what the \u2018new normal\u2019 is going to look like. What has this all meant for the European Society of Coloproctology? When Per Nilsson\u2019s Presidential report [1] was published in September 2019, the same month of our 14th Annual meeting in Vienna, the society was in very good shape. All committees were under full steam \u2018climbing uphill at downhill speed\u2019. The membership had risen to an unprecedented number of 2000, and the Vienna meeting was a big success with more than 1800 attendants. The themes of the year 2019\u2013 2020 were (gender) diversity and global reach. Gender diversity requires attention, also within ESCP. Our young ESCP members Tina van Loon and Rosa Jimenez had shown us that we were doing even worse than ASCRS having only 20% of female speakers at our annual conference in 2017 [2]. Global reach, focusing particularly on societies in the far East, for example China, Korea and Hong Kong, seem somewhat ridiculous with severe travel restrictions. Especially, the planned masterclasses and face-to-face encounters that are so special for diverse cultural backgrounds seemed to stall and were not compatible with a global COVID-19 pandemic that started off in these countries. Nevertheless, being a European society, we aim to have a global footprint and develop interesting relationships with Societies of Coloproctology all around the world. At the same time, we should not neglect our traditional partners, for example ASCRS and the underrepresented member countries within ESCP. The winter meeting of the executive was held in Vilnius to create appetite for the upcoming meeting 15th ESCP in Vilnius 2020 at the end of January, and all was still good. The executive committee of the ESCP was very satisfied the way the various committees delivered the content (chair programme committee Des Winter) for the very successful Vienna meeting consisting of precongress hands-on courses, keynote lectures, thematic sessions, hot debates, multiple educational sessions, research sessions and young ESCP sessions topped off with a grand ESCP festivity evening attended by the younger generations of ESCP members, the future of our society; it had been a good choice to replace the traditional presidential dinner with an event accessible for all. It was a big success. During the executive winter meeting, the numerous committees reported on their achievements and future activities. The educational committee chaired by Dieter Hahnloser not only excelled in educational activities during the annual meeting, but also delivered an all year-round programme.

Early reports from China indicate that persons with cancer are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 [2]. However, there are no data on the prevalence of COVID-19 in different types of cancer, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is the most frequent leukemia in Western countries with an incidence of 4.2:100,000/year, increasing to more than 30:100,000/year at an age of >80 years. The median age at diagnosis is 72 years, and most patients are older than 60 years. Data from US SEER estimated >20,000 newly diagnosed cases of CLL in 2019 [3]. CLL is frequently accompanied by immunodefiency (that can be aggravated by therapy) and comorbidity. Infections are the first cause of death in CLL. Cancer, older age, inmmunodeficiency, and chronic diseases are all risk factors for COVID-19 [4]. It could be hypothesized, therefore, that patients with CLL are among those with a higher risk to contract COVID-19. However, the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of patients with CLL and COVID-19 infection have not yet been established, and to obtain the full picture will take time. Meanwhile, preliminary information from large series of patients can be useful. The Hospital Clinic from Barcelona is a reference center for CLL. In the period 2000\u20132019, 804 patients with CLL were registered. The median age was 67 years. The median overall survival is 11.8 years. Three hundred and eightyfour patients have died; in 236 with available information, infection was the cause of death in 35% subjects. The median follow-up of 420 patients who remain alive is 7.9 years. Four of these patients (0.95%) have been diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19. Their characteristics and outcome are shown in the Table 1. Of note, the number of patients with COVID-19 admitted at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona as of 6 May 2020 is 2366. All four patients were males, old and suffered from comorbidity; three had increased ferritin levels; two presented lymphocytopenia; and one had increased D-dimer levels, all features associated with poor outcome in COVID19 [4]. Also, two patients had previously received therapy for CLL. Despite this, the course of the disease was mild, and no patient required admission in an intensive care unit; three patients quickly recovered after 4\u20138 days and one after 24 days of experimental therapy for COVID-19. It could be speculated that the CLL-related immunodeficiency, rather than exacerbating the effects of SARS-Cov-2 might prevent them [5]. This, as well as the potential role of immunomodulatory agents (e.g., ibrutinib) on the outcome of patients with CLL infected by SARS-Cov-2, deserves investigation [6, 7]. The concept that patients with cancer have a high-risk for COVID-19 derives from reports describing the underlying conditions in patients with COVID-19 [8, 9]. Ours is the first attempt to directly determining the prevalence of COVID-19 in CLL. In short, 4 of 420 (0.95%) patients, representative of the general CLL population, have been so far diagnosed with mild, symptomatic COVID-19. The seemingly low prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in CLL needs to be taken cautiously as the number of cases may increase as long as the pandemic persists. Several recently launched studies, will help to clarify the prevalence of COVID-19 in CLL, its clinical characteristics, optimal therapy, and outcome. Meanwhile, this interim report based on a large series of patients provides a frame to gauge the likely impact of COVID-19 on patients with CLL. Also, different organisms have issued helpful recommendations on the prevention of COVID-19 in patients with CLL or cancer in this dramatic and challenging moment [10, 11]. * Emili Montserrat emontse@clinic.cat", "authors": ["T.

Some people denounced it as breach of trust or contract, Pfizer complained this had not been trialled and recipients who expected to have two prompt doses were furious. However, others were delighted and indeed this decision has long since been vindicated. Half a loaf is indeed much better than no bread. The strategy hugely increased the number of people who received some protection against the virus and avoided falling ill or going into hospital if they did. Quite how much protection was gained was uncertain but it was significant and far better than nothing at all (the alternative for so many vulnerable people). Jeremy Bentham as the original protagonist of \u2018the greatest good for the greatest number\u2019 would have cheered it on and been delighted that the result was a resounding success at a time when the UK was being overwhelmed by a devastating second wave of the pandemic with the so-called Kent variant proving far more virulent and transmissible than the original strain. As the death rate soared seemingly out of control and testing showed the numbers were huge in the population, this bold decision taken against a stream of sometimes abusive criticisms probably saved many thousands of lives as well as lost days or even weeks or months of work due to non fatal symptoms that may stretch into \u2018long Covid\u2019. The effect of even a single vaccination has since been shown to significantly lower the risks of transmitting the virus as well, so it provided a double benefit to the UK population. Delaying the second dose of the vaccine and continuing with the widespread distribution of the AZ Oxford vaccine alongside the Pfizer vaccine moving down the generations was and remains the most sensible and effective use of our resources for the benefit of the population. The seemingly endless drip-drip of unfounded criticisms of the A-Z Oxford vaccine which made no sense in terms of balancing the scientifically miniscule risks of causing a blood clot in a very few unlucky individuals as compared with the much higher risk of a blood clot and much else from contracting Covid has in my view cost many thousands of lives by reason of causing doubt and delay in its distribution. It seemed to me, personally, suspiciously politically and or financially motivated, and a new variant of \u2018sour grapes\u2019. Is it without significance that the A-Z Oxford vaccine is being supplied on a not for profit basis? That it is far easier and cheaper to distribute as it can be kept in a normal fridge rather than at very low temperatures? Did it dent the enormous demand for much more expensive vaccines that were making huge profits for the companies who manufactured and distributed them along with their shareholders? The market is so huge there is room for many more manufacturers right now.

Evidence is presented to suggest that there is a potential for beach-going behaviors to be influenced by other beach users and past observations, whether the behavior of others conforms to warnings about the dangers posed by rips in general or at a specific time and place.

Social media is increasingly important to business, and a Harvard Business Review article encourages readers to be \u2018\u2018authentic and consistent.\u2019\u2019 One definition of authenticity is that it \u2018\u2018involves an awareness of one\u2019s self; unbiased processing of self-relevant information; behaving in accord with one\u2019s core values, inclinations, needs, and so forth; and relating to close others in genuine, trustworthy, and honest ways.\u2019\u2019 The field of positive psychology, about which we have written previously and which focuses on the science of well-being, confirms that being authentic correlates with higher levels of life satisfaction and well-being. What does it feel like to be authentic? One study of state authenticity\u2014defined as being true to one\u2019s self\u2014showed that contentment, calmness, and social ease were common feelings when one is authentic. In the study, personal stories related to feeling authentic were about having fun, doing something familiar, working toward success, and just hanging out. When a study participant thought about one of these past authentic behaviors, (s)he felt nostalgic and enjoyed a positive mood. Do these positive feelings last, or do they diminish over time? One longitudinal study found that being authentic on social media sites significantly contributed to feelings of well-being and showed \u2018\u2018significant longitudinal effects on positive affect, negative affect, and satisfaction with life.\u2019\u2019 This study also showed that subjective well-being was a predictor of online authenticity. The opposite was also true: Social media users with lower levels of well-being were less likely to feel they could be authentic\u2014and consequently reap the health benefits of online authenticity\u2014due to the \u2018\u2018positivity bias\u2019\u2019 of social network communication. In other words, it\u2019s hard for Facebook users to be positive when they don\u2019t feel they have anything positive to say. In addition, users may feel peer pressure not to share their negative feelings online. Just like \u2018\u2018awesome,\u2019\u2019 the word \u2018\u2018authentic\u2019\u2019 has been so overused as to have different meanings to different people. One student\u2019s definition of Facebook authenticity is \u2018\u2018me on my best day.\u2019\u2019 For users who may feel reluctant to share anything less than their best selves on Facebook, perhaps other online venues may be a more appropriate use of social networking time. For example, a depression support forum may provide a suitable outlet if a Facebook user is depressed. Of course, if the option for real-world socialization is there, getting out of the house and hanging with friends may prove helpful. We hope that Facebook users will feel encouraged to share more of themselves online in light of the fact that being authentic online is thus far proving to have the same health benefits as being authentic in face-to-face encounters.", "authors": ["B.

According to the main research hypothesis, individuals who discuss on political Facebook pages prefer the information published by the media ideologically close to the party administrating the page, and discriminate the others. However, the research material (c.a. 36.5 thousand links to news media which Facebook users used since September 2015 to February 2017) suggest that on political Facebook pages, users refer to a variety of sources. Development of the internet and social media has made it possible for their users to extend their control over the process of obtaining information. No other technologies either the press, radio or television have given so much choice of time of acquiring information, and source. Individuals also decide how much information they want to get regarding a given topic. Considering the relatively low cost of access to the Internet, one could assume that it will contribute to a significant expansion of knowledge and political development of citizens. Among the researchers who do not fully share this optimistic vision, however, there is a belief that the freedom of choice can have adverse consequences for users. The users create their own, individually tailored information environment by choosing the content they are familiar with, choosing the sources they trust, and making decisions with whom to be friends and who to observe with social media. In this way, on the one hand, users obtain a set of information that they consider the most interesting and the most reliable; on the other hand, this subjective selection can be very biased and systematically exclude information inconsistent with previously held beliefs. The result of such a scenario is user-created information environment adapted to their needs, and their vision of the world; the so-called echo chamber. In other words, such individuals usually come in contact with those who share their views and with information that confirms their beliefs. In this context, it should be remembered that social media has also led to a change in the way information is produced and distributed, which in turn may affect its quality in the network. In the case of the users\u2019 activity in the internet and social media, there is no restrictive control over the transmitted content. There are no so-called gatekeepers, who verify the accuracy of information, and the average user is not a journalist who is properly educated, has the professional skills to seek reliable information and act in accordance with journalistic ethics. Also, there is little or no criminal liability for disseminating uncertain or even completely false information. This has led to the situation where, although recipients have access to a huge number of diversified information, at the same time they are fully responsible for the 1 S. Coleman, J.G.

It is only up to them how important the information will be in the process of formulating political beliefs and attitudes, as well as gathering political knowledge. It is worth bearing in mind that they \u201c(...) often are not uninformed about policy, as political scientists continue to emphasize, but misinformed. People hold inaccurate factual beliefs, and do so confidently. The problem, then, at least with respect to attitudes about public policy, is not that people simply lack information, but that they firmly hold the wrong information \u2013 and use it to form preferences.\u201d. Threats resulting from the use of social media in the process of incorporating uncertain, distorted or even false information seem to be very real. For example, any Twitter user can publish any, not necessarily true information, support it with a properly selected photo or video and reach the same or even more recipients than evening TV news. However, this information is not controlled, as in the case of media companies, which until recently had exclusive access to the media, and themselves decided on what will be shown, how often and in what context. As a result of the changes that occurred after the revolution 2.0, it is not the sender (usually a small group of people), but the recipients (mass) who began to control the content. They decide what interest them and what they want to share with others. At the same time, among individuals who actively search for information increases the probability that they read them more accurately and spend more time doing this. As a result, such information has a stronger impact on their beliefs than an accidental one, for example, acquired while watching TV news. In the presented context, it is of particular importance to which and how diversified sources the users of social media refer to. A quite specific case was chosen for the research Facebook pages of the largest Polish political parties and their leaders. Let's assume that Facebook pages mainly group supporters of a given group, that is, they are relatively homogenous. This is due, among others, to the fact that liking the page, and thus increasing the chances of encountering the content published on it, is an act that can cause cognitive 4 P.E.

For example, a person associated with left-wing movements could arouse controversy among her Facebook friends if she had information on her profile that she liked, for example, the National Movement website. Facebook allows commenting on pages by people who did not add those pages to their favourites. However, there is a question about the control of published content. The page's homogeneity is related to the actions taken by its administrators who decide what appears on it. Although the scope of tolerance for unfavourable comments is probably diverse, it can be assumed that some people, due to their views or repeated unfavourable actions, are blocked, which increases homogeneity. In addition, due to the clearly defined nature of these pages, it can be assumed that supporting comments are favoured (they are liked and meet with other positive comments) by followers of a given page, while unfavourable comments will be discriminated (less frequently liked, meet with negative comments from users who like the page). This type of social content control if it actually exists should confirm the previous beliefs of supporters of a given political party. The article aims to investigate whether typical users of political Facebook pages tend to limit the sources they use in discussions to those preferred in a given political environment. In connection with the above, the author formulates the following main hypothesis and two auxiliary hypotheses: H1: There is a clear division between users of political parties\u2019 Facebook pages in terms of which information media (newspapers, magazines, internet portals, TV stations, radio stations) they refer to. They prefer information published by media ideologically close to the party that administrates the page and at the same time discriminate other sources. H1-1: A user posting a link that is incompatible with the ideological line of a given group, faces discrimination from followers of a given page. This means that comments containing preferred sources will be more liked than those containing non-preferred sources.

In one scenario, a man is seen cutting and polishing a diamond; in another, a group of actors rehearses The House with the Mezzanine, an 1896 play by Anton Chekov about a clash between peasants and city dwellers; and in a third, a group of friends discusses, over a Turkish meal, a proposed film about children forced to smuggle black-market goods across the treacherous Turkish-Syrian border.

It had been washed ashore on Key West and was protected by a case made of acrylic glass, designed for underwater use. Schultz took the camera home and downloaded the photos from its memory on his computer. As they largely contained ordinary snapshots, depicting scenes from everyday family life and holiday activities, they did not give away any information about the owner of the device. Schultz therefore published them on several Internet sites that are dedicated to tourism and diving,1 hoping that someone else might find any clues. Indeed, a visitor of one of the sites recognized the children in some of the pictures. Shordy after, Dick de Bruin, the children's father, received a parcel with his fully functioning camera and its waterproof case. The Dutch naval officer was stationed in Aruba, an island of the Lesser Antilles in the southern Caribbean. He had lost the camera while diving on November 11, 2009, half a year before it had washed ashore in Key West. Traveling from the Antilles to Florida through two oceans, the device had covered a distance of more than eleven hundred miles.This remarkable anecdote is a story about moving images and moving with images, about photographs traveling from coastal South America to North America and back-or, to be precise, about a camera traveling with the photographs stored in its memory. Beyond that, another form of image movement comes into play because of the intervention of a sea turtle. The marine reptile appears to have used the traveling camera to shoot a short film, which Schultz found on the memory card among de Bruin's pictures. The clip in question had been recorded, as the metadata of the file indicated, on January 15, 2010, during the camera's sea voyage, long after it had been lost by its owner.As Schultz reckoned, the camera must have been floating somewhere off the coast of Honduras that day, and this is where the sea turtle approached it. Probably the animal mistook the device for food and snatched at it. In any case, the turtle hit the release button. And because the camera had been set to video mode by de Bruin before disappearing into the ocean, it started filming. The clip that the camera recorded shows how the turtle plays around with it, banging against it, snapping at it, and keeping it in constant motion. The images that were captured in the process are rather shaky, as the camera is incessantly performing hectic tilts and pans. In one moment the lens is directed toward the clear blue sky, while in the next second it turns to show the Caribbean underwater world. Only occasionally the turtle itself can be seen-until, after five minutes, it loses interest and swims away. The video continues for another fifteen uneventful minutes before the battery goes dead, with the lens headed toward the sky, washed over by seawater from time to time.Schultz edited out the ending and put the rest of the film on YouTube. Uploaded on May 28, 2010, under the tide \"Sea Turtle Finds Lost Camera,\" the clip generated nearly 2.7 million clicks and was commented on as of February 2014 more than 3,500 times.2Introduction: Cats, Pigeons, and TurtlesImages in general and photographic images in particular are and have always been more than just products of human intention. Nonhuman actors may play a crucial role in their production as well. A striking example is provided not only recently by the directorial debut of the sea turtle but even much earlier by carrier pigeons, which since 1906 were used by Julius Neubronner to take aerial photographs. The German pharmacist developed cameras with a lightweight self-timer and attached them to the birds before he let them loose. When they returned home, the devices would contain pictures that had been taken during flight.3 Neubronner sold the equipment he had invented to pigeon breeders and amateur photographers, and his small enterprise can thus be considered a predecessor of projects such as Mr. \u2026", "authors": ["F.

Stereoscopes made it possible to see a pair of slightly different two-dimensional photographs in three dimensions by making use of the human eye\u2019s parallax. With this century\u2019s new possibilities in three-dimensional computing, historic stereoscopic images can now be used for the creation of interactive virtual environments. Driven by the wish to make historic stereo images interactively accessible to the user, we have developed an immersive virtual environment called \"Time_lapse.\" This system allows two remotely located users to enter and interact with historic stereo images through full-body integration and immersion. 1. A Brief History of Stereoscopic Vision 1.1. Early forms of stereo vision The fascination with the concept of stereo vision goes back to ancient Greece around 300 B.C. Euclid for the first time explained the principle of binocular vision. He demonstrated that the right and left eyes see slightly different versions of the same scene and that the merging of these two images produces the perception of depth. In the sixteenth century, Leonardo Da Vinci experimented with perspective in an effort to create the impression of depth in his paintings. Around the same time, the Florentine painter Jacopo Chimenti created pairs of \"stereo\" drawings. During the Industrial Revolution, demand for more sophisticated forms of viewing resulted in the developments of new techniques, including magic laterns, the polyorama panoptique, peep shows and the kaleidoscope. [1] 1.2. Brewster\u2019s Stereoscope However, it was the invention of photography that really made mass-culture 3-D viewing possible. The first patented stereo viewer was Sir Charles Wheatstone\u2019s reflecting stereoscope in 1838. The device was a bulky and complicated contraption that utilized a system of mirrors to view a series of pairs of crude drawings. In 1844 a technique for taking stereoscopic photographs was demonstrated in Germany, and a much smaller and simpler viewer that utilized prismatic lenses was developed in Scotland by David Brewster (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Stereo viewer for \"Crystal Palace\" Henry NEGRETTI & Joseph ZAMBRA. 1.3. Crystal Palace a breakthrough for the stereoscope The real breakthrough for Brewster\u2019s Stereoscope came in 1851 with the opening of the Great Exhibition in London\u2019s Crystal Palace located in Hyde Park. Many countries of the world were represented in an extravagant display housed in this huge glass building designed by engineer Joseph Paxton. Its beautiful domed roof (Fig. 2) made it the perfect setting for the stereo photographs taken by the company Negretti and Zambra. The various attractions in the Crystal Palace included \"The Medieval Hall,\" \"The Lotus Pond,\" \"Egypt\" (Fig. 3), and \"Rome,\" among others. When Queen Victoria took a fancy to the Stereoscope at the Crystal Palace exposition in 1851, stereo viewing became vastly popular in Britain.

Touring the world from home The stereoscope slides that were produced allowed people to sit in their own home and tour the world. The most popular slides were travelogues that showed the world from the abbeys and countrysides of Europe to the pyramids and tombs of ancient Egypt, to the Great Wall of China, and to the Taj Mahal (Fig. 4). The great events of the day found their way onto the stereo slides. The building of the Panama Canal, the terrors of war, and the destruction of natural disasters such as earthquakes were brought into homes in much the same way as television does today. By the 1870\u2019s, local commercial photographers had sprung up around the country, and for a fee they would produce stereo slides of one\u2019s farm, family or shop (Fig. 5).

To adapt the images for the construction of our three-dimensional immersive interactive environment and to provide the user with an immersive interaction experience, various image preparation processes were needed. These are described below. 2.1. Image preparation The following sections describe the image processing steps performed on the stereo images to make them suitable for interactive viewing and exploration by the user. There are three main processes: image acquisition, depth extraction and virtual views generation for motion parallax. The image\u2019s depth is used to achieve the interposition depth clue, where near objects occlude far objects. Virtual views are synthetically generated to enhance the depth effect provided by the motion parallax clue, where near objects move more than distant ones. 2.1.1. Image acquisition A total of 15 historic colour stereo images were selected from the collection of the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Art. Left and right image pairs were scanned from a book[1] at 300 dpi and then scaled down to a 512x512 pixel resolution. No colour adjustment was made during the scanning process. Due perhaps to their antiquity, the images\u2019 quality is anything but optimal. Judging from the era they were taken, we can conclude that they are indeed black and white images. However, some of them seem to be retouched to give them a coloured appearance. Also, the colours are fading away. These image sets could be viewed with a rather simple stereo-viewer provided with the book. The images were taken using stereo cameras with lenses separation, also called inter-ocular separation or baseline, that is roughly equal to the average human eye\u2019s separation of 55-65 mm. Most of the scenes were carefully chosen to give a relatively good stereoscopic effect in spite of the short lens separation. 2.1.2. Depth extraction Due to the less than optimal quality of the scanned images, the image colours between left and right images differed significantly, so a general correlation-based stereo matching algorithm to extract a dense depth map was not appropriate. However, we applied a recursive and adaptive stereo matching algorithm [4], based on the Kanade-Okutomi[5] algorithm, to our images. No image rectification was needed since the camera lenses\u2019 setup assures that epipolar lines coincide with raster scan lines in the image. Depth extraction results were, as expected, not very precise (Fig. 6).", "authors": ["C. Sommerer", "L. Mignonneau", "R.

From these black and white images, three were selected to be in the following two group shows that focused on Rome: \u2018Ruination \u2013 Rome\u2019 Group show, Djanogly Gallery, Nottingham University, 23rd February to 6th April 2008, curated by Richard Wrigley and Neil Walker and \u2018Responding to Rome, British Artists in Rome 1995 \u2013 2005\u2019, group show, Esoteric Collection of Italian Modern Art, London, 18 January 2006 - 26 March 2006, curated by Jacapo Benci. \n \nExhibition one \u2013 \u2018Ruination \u2013 Rome\u2019 Group show, Djanogly Gallery, Nottingham University. Rome has been a compelling subject for photographers since the medium's earliest days. Images of Rome originally served as forms of truthful witness to the artistic splendours of the past. Once valued as replications of antique architecture and sculpture in situ, it is now their extraordinary power as images - their technical and artistic subtlety - which allows them to transcend their function as homages to the city. \n \nRuination brings together a series of arresting images of Rome produced by photographers of the mid-nineteenth and late-twentieth centuries. Richard Billingham had three large framed photographic works selected, other contemporary artists included Olivio Barbieri, Fiona Crisp and John Riddy. \n \nThere was a fully illustrated catalogue of the exhibition published 2008 published by the Djanogly Gallery with an essay by Richard Wrigley. \n \nThere was an illustrated introduction to \u2018Ruination\u2019 by exhibition curator Richard Wrigley 8th March at the Djanogly Art Gallery Lecture Theatre \n \nThere were also two illustrated lectures by Fiona Crisp relating her experience during her scholarship at the British School in Rome and Katharina Lorenz from the University\u2019s Department of Classics who spoke about representations of the classical and modern city. \n \nExhibition two - \u2018Responding to Rome, British Artists in Rome 1995 \u2013 2005\u2019, group show, Esoteric Collection of Italian Modern Art, London \n \n\u2018Responding to Rome\u2019 was supported by the Henry Moore Foundation and showed the work of thirty-five selected contemporary British artists who were awarded scholarships at the British School at Rome from 1995 \u2013 2005. All the works exhibited were either realised during the artists\u2019 stay in Rome or as a direct consequence of it, and they have given shape to their Roman and Italian experience in a wide variety of media. In widely differing ways, all works bore witness to the unfathomable allure and wealth of Rome. The exhibition illustrated how the traditional Grand Tour evolved into a lively, contemporary experience, and how diversity in the practice of and approach to visual art is encouraged and facilitated at the British School at Rome. \n \nRichard Billingham had three large framed photographic pieces included. Both Billingham and John Riddy explored quintessentially Roman images in their large black and white photographs Colosseum and Trajan\u2019s Markets. Smith/Stewart created a three-minute colour film entitled Lovers, Rome, whilst Marion Coutt\u2019s colour film followed four human bearers as they processed through the streets of Rome carrying a life-size model of a horse.

Methods and Results This was a cohort study of 1696 patients with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or transient ischemic attack seen in a cerebrovascular clinic from February 17, 2015, to June 11, 2018, who completed the following PROs at the visit: Patient Health Questionnaire\u20109, Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders cognitive function, PROMIS Global Health, sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety, social role satisfaction, physical function, and pain interference.

These rules are shaped by beliefs and values and are subject to revision through the democratic legislative process. For the most part, the rules are well known and widely followed. Society functions on the premise that its members are aware of and will follow the rules. Our criminal justice system, in turn, is designed to determine if a violation of society\u2019s rules occurred and whether that violation warrants a sanction. If so, the justice system assesses the level of responsibility, culpability, and punishment appropriate for individual offenders. Given these responsibilities, the criminal justice system has to make decisions regarding individuals. These decisions often involve prediction. Indeed, most decisions in the criminal justice system involve some form of prediction. Consider, for example, the following decisions: choosing whether or not to grant bail, probation, or parole to an individual; establishing whether an individual is eligible for treatment; and determining his or her appropriate sentence. Each of these processes involves some type of evaluation of an individual in order to make a decision \u2014 ideally an informed, objective, and reliable decision \u2014 about what he or she is likely to do or to not do in the future.A key concern for the criminal justice system is an individual\u2019s likelihood of displaying future antisocial behavior, or behavior that involves a disregard for the rules and the well-being of others. The traditional assessments used to evaluate offenders for future risk of antisocial or violent behavior include self-reporting measures, various types of interviews, and expert-administered test batteries. These tools seek to assess possible intellectual and cognitive impairment and to measure psychological and neuropsychological constructs, including personality states and traits. But, given that the brain has the most proximal influence on behavior, direct measures of brain structure and function may be better than proxy measures in predicting future antisocial behavior. The question then becomes: If we can get information from neuroscience techniques, does that information add predictive utility to understanding and assessing antisocial behavior? To date, studies suggest that it does.Part I of this Article reviews the tools currently available to predict antisocial behavior. Part II discusses legal precedent regarding the use of, and challenges to, various prediction methods. Part III introduces recent neuroscience work in this area and reviews two studies that have successfully used neuroimaging techniques to predict recidivism. Part IV discusses some criticisms that are commonly levied against the various prediction methods and highlights the disparity between the attitudes of the scientific and legal communities toward risk assessment generally and neuroscience specifically.

Such information is key for constraining climatic and ice-sheet models that are used to predict future Antarctic Ice Sheet\u00a0AIS melting. However, data required to make a detailed reconstruction of the history of the EAIS involving changes in its thickness and lateral extent since the LGM remain sparse. Here, we present a new detailed ice-sheet history for the southern Soya Coast, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East Antarctica, based on geomorphological observations and surface exposure ages. Our results demonstrate that the ice sheet completely covered the highest peak of Skarvsnes (400\u00a0m a.s.l.) prior to \u223c9 ka and retreated eastward by at least 10\u00a0km during the Early to Mid-Holocene (ca. 9 to 5 ka). The timing of the abrupt ice-sheet thinning and retreat is consistent with the intrusion of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) into deep submarine valleys in Lutzow-Holm Bay, as inferred from fossil foraminifera records of marine sediment cores. Thus, we propose that the mechanism of the abrupt thinning and retreat of the EAIS along the southern Soya Coast was marine ice-sheet instability caused by mCDW intrusion into deep submarine valleys. Such abrupt ice-sheet thinning and retreat with similar magnitude and timing have also been reported from Enderby Land, East Antarctica. Our findings suggest that abrupt thinning and retreat as a consequence of marine ice-sheet instability and intrusion of mCDW during the Early to Mid-Holocene may have led to rapid ice-surface lowering of hundreds of meters in East Antarctica.", "authors": ["Moto Kawamata", "Y.

Past research, however, offered mixed support for this hypothesis. The present 12 research used a large nationally representative sample and a longitudinal design to examine the 13 predictive utility of implicit and explicit attitude measures in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. 14 In our analyses, explicit attitudes toward candidates predicted voting better for decided than 15 undecided voters, but implicit candidate attitudes were predictive of voting for both decided and 16 undecided voters. Extending our examination to implicit and explicit racial attitudes, we found 17 the same pattern. Taken together, these results provide convergent evidence that implicit 18 attitudes predict voting about as well for the undecided as for decided voters. We also evaluated 19 a novel explanation for these effects by evaluating whether implicit attitudes may predict the 20 choices of undecided voters, in part, because they are overlooked when people introspect about 21 their confidence. Consistent with this idea, we found that the extremity of explicit but not 22 implicit attitudes was associated with greater confidence. These analyses shed new light on the 23 utility of implicit measures in predicting future behavior among individuals who feel undecided. 24 Considering the prior studies together with this new evidence, the data seem to be consistent that 25 implicit attitudes may be successful in predicting the behavior of undecided voters. 26 Decisions among the Undecided 3 Introduction 27 What does it mean when someone says they are undecided about how to vote just weeks 28 before an important election? Do undecided voters truly have no clear preferences? Or, do they 29 simply lack conscious insight into what their preferences are? In either case, undecided voters 30 are hard to ignore. Less than two months before the 2012 U.S. presidential election, five percent 31 of voters in swing states were undecided, and another 17% said they might change their minds 32 [1]. These percentages are more than enough to decide most elections, making the prediction of 33 undecided voters\u2019 behavior an important problem for pollsters and social scientists. Is it possible 34 to predict the behavior of individuals who cannot predict their own? 35 Psychologists have recently suggested an innovative solution to this problem. Galdi, 36 Arcuri, and Gawronski [2] proposed that a key to predicting the behavior of undecided voters lies 37 in the distinction between explicit and implicit attitudes. Explicit attitudes are evaluations of 38 topics that are consciously endorsed and voluntarily reported. Traditional self-report surveys, 39 including the questions asked in polls, measure explicit attitudes. In contrast, implicit attitudes 40 are spontaneous evaluations that are automatically evoked when encountering or contemplating 41 an issue. Implicit evaluations come to mind whether or not they are endorsed as true. They may 42 affect behavior even when their influence is unwanted. 43 Galdi and colleagues [2] proposed that explicit attitudes are stronger predictors of 44 behavior for decided voters than undecided voters, but implicit attitudes are stronger predictors 45 for undecided voters than decided voters. They reasoned that implicit attitudes may indirectly 46 influence future voting behavior by biasing the processing of decision-relevant information. To 47 the extent that people use this biased set of information in making a deliberate decision, implicit 48 attitudes may predict eventual decisions even though respondents are undecided when the 49 Decisions among the Undecided 4 implicit attitudes are measured. Evidence for this hypothesis was reported by Galdi, Gawronski, 50 Arcuri, and Friese [3], who demonstrated that the implicit attitudes of undecided participants 51 predicted selective exposure to information consistent with their implicit attitudes. Individuals 52 who describe themselves as undecided may therefore have implicit attitudes that will ultimately 53 lead to conscious preferences, but have not yet done so (see also [4]). 54 There is additional reason to believe that implicit attitudes may predict behavior for 55 undecided voters: Being \u201cdecided\u201d or \u201cundecided\u201d is a meta-cognitive judgment that people 56 make about their own decision processes. Models of explicit and implicit attitudes suggest that 57 people are more likely to consider their explicit attitudes to be a valid basis for judgment [5,6]. 58 Whereas explicit attitudes are experienced as conscious preferences or \u201cconsidered opinions,\u201d 59 implicit attitudes tend to be experienced as \u201cgut feelings\u201d [5,7]. 60 We suggest that, when people indicate whether they have decided, they are more likely to 61 base this judgment on their consciously endorsed (i.e., explicit) attitudes than on implicit 62 attitudes. If explicit attitudes strongly favor one option over the other, then the respondent will 63 claim to be decided, whereas if the explicit attitude is weak, unclear, or ambivalent, then the 64 respondent will claim to be undecided. Based on this reasoning, explicit attitudes should be more 65 predictive of behavior among decided voters than undecided voters. Introspection, however, may 66 overlook implicit attitudes. When people introspect about whether they have decided, they may 67 focus on consciously endorsed attitudes and neglect implicit attitudes as though they were 68 invisible. Implicit attitudes would nonetheless be automatically activated and would still have the 69 potential to influence behavior. Based on this introspective invisibility hypothesis, implicit 70 attitudes should be equally predictive of behavior among the decided and the undecided. 71 Decisions among the Undecided 5 The introspective invisibility account and the biased processing account make different 72 predictions about whether implicit attitudes should predict behavior for decided voters after 73 explicit attitudes have been accounted for. Under the biased processing account, implicit 74 attitudes lead to deliberate decisions only indirectly, by biasing the formation of the deliberate 75 decision. Once the biased information search has led to a deliberate decision, no direct effect of 76 implicit attitudes is predicted over and above the effects of explicit attitudes. Both accounts thus 77 predict that implicit attitudes should predict decisions among the undecided, but only the 78 introspective invisibility account predicts that implicit attitudes should be similarly predictive 79 among decided voters, after removing the effects of explicit attitudes. 80 Do Implicit Attitudes Predict Future Behavior of Undecided Voters? 81 The theoretical reasons that implicit attitudes might predict the behavior of undecided 82 voters are clear, but the empirical evidence to date has been mixed. In this section, we review the 83 results of the most relevant previous studies. One study by Arcuri and colleagues [8] examined 84 implicit political attitudes in the 2001 Italian general election. This study found that implicit 85 attitudes predicted voting intentions for both decided and undecided voters, consistent with the 86 idea that voters neglect implicit attitudes when they assess whether they are decided. Based on 87 this finding, implicit attitude measures should be useful in predicting the behavior of undecided 88 voters even if the voters themselves do not yet know how they will vote. However, this study did 89 not simultaneously account for explicit measures and, therefore, cannot speak to the unique 90 predictive power of implicit measures. 91 A second study by Galdi and colleagues [2] compared implicit and explicit attitudes 92 toward a politically charged issue in an Italian sample. In separate analyses for decided and 93 undecided participants, this study found that explicit, but not implicit, attitudes were predictive 94 Decisions among the Undecided 6 of future choices among decided participants. In contrast, implicit, but not explicit, attitudes were 95 predictive of future choices among undecided participants. This pattern suggests that voters rely 96 on explicit attitudes when assessing whether they have decided, but when they are undecided 97 they rely more on implicit attitudes. These analyses, too, suggest that implicit attitude measures 98 should be especially useful in predicting the behavior of undecided voters. However, in multiple 99 regression analyses that treated decidedness as a dummy-coded moderator variable, explicit 100 attitudes were not moderated by confidence in predicting future choices, while implicit attitudes 101 were. While this finding corroborates the account that implicit attitudes may be more predictive 102 for undecided than decided voters, it also suggests that explicit attitudes may be equally 103 predictive for both decided and undecided voters. 104 Finally, Friese and colleagues [9] examined the ability of implicit and explicit attitude 105 measures to predict voting behavior in the 2008 presidential election in the United States and the 106 2009 parliamentary election in Germany. Across three sets of multiple regression analyses that 107 treated decidedness as a moderator variable and examined implicit attitude measures separately, 108 implicit attitudes were consistently predictive of voting behavior, and they were more predictive 109 for decided than undecided respondents (in contrast to Galdi et al.\u2019s [2] findings). However, the 110 variance due to explicit attitudes and their interaction with decidedness was not removed in these 111 analyses. Because explicit and implicit attitudes were strongly correlated in these samples (rs 112 between .52 and .72), implicit attitudes may have spuriously appeared to be more predictive 113 among decided than undecided voters because of the shared variance with explicit attitudes. 114 Indeed, once explicit a", "authors": ["K.

A timeline for this eventuality has never been defined. National implantation rates from 2003-2010 provided by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART) in the USA were evaluated. Regression analysis was applied to the annual trends. A high correlation was noted showing a linear increase from year to year ranging between 0.3% and 1.5% when maternal age was not higher than 42. This relationship can be retrospectively applied to earlier SART data reports. This incline may be partly technology driven and resembles Moore's law, which describes annual improvements in microchip performance. Based on the assumption that technology will continue to drive progress, the length of time required to reach 100% implantation was calculated. The interval varied between 43 years (AD 2053) for the youngest age group (<35 years old) and 294 years for the 41-42-year age group. The timeframe is shifted for the younger patients to an earlier date of 2027 if a subset of clinics with high implantation regression slopes and low variance is selected. The implications of these findings for infertility treatment and fertility preservation are discussed. Success after IVF has steadily improved. Data from US-based clinics are annually collected by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART; www.sart.org). Through SART, individual clinic's outcomes may be assessed. Although live birth and pregnancy are considered the gold standard of success, the investigators took the approach that those outcomes are often biased due to transfer of multiple embryos. The present analysis was therefore performed on individual embryos, by using the implantation rate to compare national and individual clinic datasets. National implantation rates show a linear increase from year to year ranging between 0.3% and 1.5% for patients aged <43 years. We postulate that this linear trend can be traced back to 1985 even though statistical analysis could only be applied to the implantation data from 2003-2010. We expect that this annual incline is partly technology driven. This is an intriguing effect also seen in the computer industry where there has been a doubling of computer speed and memory for the past 47 years, a phenomenon anticipated by Moore's law. We predict that the annual increase in implantation will also continue as new technologies become available. Based on current trends, the length of time for 100% implantation rates was calculated. Time to achieving 100% implantation varied between 43 years (AD 2053) for the youngest age group (<35 years old) to 294 years for women 41-42 years old.

Narratives of Chinese massacre occluded the centrality of plantations to political struggles among Peruvians as well as the importance of Chinese labor to Chilean military occupation.

Diabetes, 67(7), 1380-1394. https://doi.org/10.2337/db18-0044", "abstract": "Fat accumulates in bone marrow (BM) of diabetic patients. Here, we investigated the mechanisms and consequences of this phenomenon. BM-mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) from type-2 diabetic (T2D) patients constitutively express adipogenic markers and robustly differentiate into adipocytes (ADPCs) upon in-vitro induction. Moreover, T2D-BM-ADPCs paracrinally stimulate a transcriptional adipogenic program in BM-MSCs, while inhibiting osteoblastogenesis. Antagonism of MCP-1, which is pivotally expressed in T2D-BM-ADPCs, prevented the T2D-BM-ADPC secretome from converting BMMSCs into ADPCs. In T2D mice, systemically-administered MCP-1 receptor antagonist improved metabolic control, reduced BM fat, and restored the proportion of osteocytes over osteoclasts. It also indirectly re-established the abundance of long-term versus short-term hematopoietic stem cells. We reveal a diabetic feedback loop wherein (1) BM-MSCs are constitutively inclined to make ADPCs and (2) mature BM-ADPCs, via secreted MCP-1, relentlessly fuel BM-MSC determination into new fat. Pharmacological inhibition of MCP-1 signalling can contrast this vicious cycle aiding bone health and hematopoiesis in diabetes. Introduction Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease because of its damaging impact on the microand macro-vasculature. Patients with T2D have twice the chance of dying from ischemic events than non-diabetic (ND) subjects (1) and those who survive suffer a markedly slower and more arduous recovery (2). This worse outcome has been attributed to the deleterious effect of T2D on angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, two intertwined reparative processes brought about by local and circulating cells (3). A defect in the mobilization of progenitor cells, such as CD34 cells, from the bone marrow (BM) represents a common feature (4) and a predictor for cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients (5, 6). Moreover, the reduced availability and functionality of circulating vasculogenic cells may be the consequence of pathogenic processes occurring within the BM microenvironment (7). Adiposity, typically associated with T2D, does not spare the BM. We previously reported an inverted relationship between adipocytes (ADPCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), where T2D patients have an almost two-fold increase in ADPCs coverage with a proportional loss of hematopoietic tissue volume (8). It remains unknown whether ADPC accumulation represents a trivial phenomenon or a pathogenic determinant of the BM adverse remodelling. Fat occupies a significant portion of the bone cavity and represents approximately 10% of the total fat mass in the body of a lean individual (9). The BM adipose tissue (BMAT) constitutes a distinct category sharing some phenotypic similarities with both white (WAT) and brown adipose tissue, but its function remains largely unknown (10). BMAT expansion can be observed in multiple pathological conditions, such as calorie restriction, radiation exposure, aging, and obesity and diabetes (8, 11-13). BM-ADPCs originate from resident mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which can differentiate into either adipocytic, osteoblastic or chondrogenic lineage (12, 14). Bone and BMAT are intimately linked as their levels are often found to be inversely correlated, with a reduced bone to BMAT ratio being considered a risk factor for bone fractures (15). Mature osteoblasts inhibit the differentiation of MSCs into adipose tissue through paracrine mechanisms. Conversely, mature BM-ADPCs influence bone mass by inhibiting the progression of BM-MSCs to osteoblasts and enhancing osteoclastogenesis (16). BMAT is also involved in the maintenance of the hematopoietic niche. In mice, BMAT expansion through obesity, aging or via adipogenic cell transplantation causes a decrease in LinSca1cKit (LSK), long-term CD34 (LT) and short-term CD34 (ST) HSCs (12). BMAT also functions as an endocrine organ, surpassing the more-widespread WAT as a source of adiponectin (ADIPOQ) (13) and secreting an extensive number of cytokines and adipokines such as Leptin (LEP), Resistin (RETN), and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1 / CCL2) (17, 18). MCP-1 is attracting growing interest for its roles in obesity and diabetes. Circulating levels of MCP-1 are elevated in obese and T2D patients (19). Furthermore, gene deletion (20) and pharmacological inhibition of MCP-1 reduce visceral MAT volume in obese mice (21, 22), suggesting a direct participation in adipogenesis. MCP-1 is also involved in the modulation of macrophages and T cells, thereby inducing \u201cWAT inflammation\u201d in T2D (23). At the molecular level, it has been reported that MCP-1, via binding to its receptor CCR2, activates the transcription of MCP-1 Induced Protein (MCPIP), which promotes adipocyte differentiation in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \uf067 (PPAR\uf067)independent manner (24, 25). The present study aims to unveil the molecular mechanisms and consequences of ADPCs accumulation in BM of T2D patients. Results highlight a feedback loop mechanism by which mature T2D-BM-ADPCs release high levels of MCP-1 which stimulates the differentiation of BM-MSCs into new ADPCs while inhibiting osteogenesis. Importantly, in-vivo antagonism of the MCP-1/CCR2 signalling in T2D mice not only decreased BMAT accumulation but also rescued osteocyte and LT-HSC depletion.

The adherent cells were considered BM-MSCs and expanded in \uf061MEM supplemented with 20% FBS. Cells from the floating phase were collected, strained through a 100\uf06dm filter and washed with HBSS (Sigma, Gillingham, UK). Cells put into culture using the modified ceiling culture method (26). 1x10 cells were seeded in a well of a 12 well culture plate (CellStar, Cardiff, UK), which was filled with \uf061MEM with 20% FBS and a 22mm borosilicate glass coverslip (VWR, Leighton, UK) was added on top of the well. Cells were incubated for 4 days and then \u201cflipped\u201d and put inside a well of a 6 well plate containing \uf061MEM. ADPCs were incubated 48 hours in FBS-free \uf061MEM. The conditioned media (CM) was then harvested and filtered through a 22\uf06dm filter (Sigma). ELISA Chemokines were quantified using ELISA kits (Biotechne, MN, USA) and following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol using 100\uf06dL of CM.

Here \u201cconstructive\u201dmeans that journalism should focus not only on social problems but also on the possible solutions and spaces of action in their coverage. This would, it is argued, lead to positive social impact and to committed readership through better audience engagement (Haagerup 2014; Gyldensted 2015). The self-corrective ethos of the idea centers on challenging journalism\u2019s tendency to focus on negativity. Crime, conflict, accidents and all kinds of threats are likely to make the headlines, while positive developments are often less dramatic and therefore go unnoticed under the news radar. This is seen to paint an overly gloomy picture of social reality, which contributes to the sense of hopelessness among audiences, who easily turn away from the news that cause them anxiety (Haagerup 2014). Constructive journalism draws inspiration and techniques from positive psychology to create engaging and inspiring stories that would provide the audience views forward (McIntyre 2015). Therefore, it underlines the role of emotion, solution formation and future orientation in news coverage (McIntyre 2015). In the European context, the idea has received positive resonance among journalism professionals, especially in public broadcasting companies. The \u201cconstructive movement\u201d is thus largely formed on the basis of professional networking: for example, The Constructive Institute is an independent organization that works closely with Aarhus University in Denmark, providing research and training (https://constructiveinstitute.org/). Several schools and universities teaching journalism have added courses on \u201cgoing constructive\u201d in their curricula; for instance, Windesheim University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands has a chair for a Professor of Constructive Journalism. In addition, European Public Broadcasting Union is currently organizing master classes in constructive journalism. Partly stemming from these networks, several academic and professional conferences on constructive journalism have taken place in the past two years. In the United States, similar ideas circulate and networking takes place under the title of solutions journalism (e.g. Solutions Journalism Network, www.solutionsjournalism.org). Some talk about solutions and constructive journalism as interchangeable; indeed, also solutions journalism questions the negativity and problem frames in news journalism and seeks to engage audiences by providing them with tools for action. Here, the main argument is that journalism should highlight existing models, solutions and responses that are showing results against the most pressing problems (Dyer 2015). The clearest difference to constructive journalism arises, however, from the fact that the argument is not similarly rooted in psychology (McIntyre 2015). The idea of constructiveness seems fresh and old at the same time.

This is to misunderstand the relation between concepts of territory and their actual practice, which are never able to bring the material world into line with the concepts that legitimate them. This narrow temporal and spatial focus limits the utility of territory as a concept, which should rather be understood as a means of moulding social processes rather than being narrowly associated with a particular means of legitimation. The focus in this study will be on territorial practices themselves, and their ability to structure understandings about the world. These practices make possible the production of ascriptive statements about the world, which are able to be realized through a variety of political practices. It is through such practices that territory is able to be produced. As the next two chapters will make clear, then actual operation of political practices was not determined by a specific concept of territory to which reference was made. Chapter 2 focuses on the notion of the map, moving away from recent studies that have tended to simplistically equate maps with power. Instead of an excessive concern with the finished object, here the focus is to examine the role of mapping as a process in the constitution of territory. It does this through a comparative examination of the mapping conducted by Tokugawa Japan and other early modern states undertaken in dialogue with recent theoretical contributions to the importance of mapping, in three particular registers. One is the concern of states with the mapping of land as a source of revenue, the second with the political mapping of their land, while the third concerns that of accurately mapping their place in the world. What will be stressed is that the actual practice of mapping was not dependent upon a particular understanding of territory, but rather the institutional context within which mapping by the state occurred. It was this which provide the background for the mapping of Ezo that occurred under the Tokugawa state, and enabled the representation of Ezo as Japan and its recognition as such. Chapter 3 reconsiders the place of borders in the early modern state, by emphasizing the importance of a border as performance, rather than a material object. Drawing on the interdisciplinary insights of border studies, it argues for the role of borders as authoritative claims to spatial extent, ones which facilitate knowledge while tying together spaces represented on the state\u2019s map. It provides a comparative look at borders in Tokugawa Japan with those of other Asian states, examining how it was that administrative borders within these polities worked to define political space. Rather than an absolute division within space, it works as a means to manage and filter the movement of people and objects across the boundary, and thus to make sense of the movement occurring space. As is emphasized, the claims made for these boundaries were not qualitatively different than those at the edge of the state, which were similarly able on occasion to find representation in natural or artificial features that were not necessarily indicative of absolute barriers to movement. Rather, the geographical limits of the state were partially constituted by the authorities established to manage them, who served as a membrane filtering the movement of goods and people, a filtering as often dependent upon the priorities of local administration as national. While it was possible to map these frontier spaces as part of the state, they were effectively constituted through the relation between local administrations and those from beyond the state\u2019s border, thus arguing for the importance of scale in considering the constitution of borders. Such scalar notions are crucial to a relational understanding of territory, which will be briefly set out at the end of this chapter. Part 2 builds upon the theoretical and empirical background provided by the first part in order to dig into the constitution of Ezo as a political space in relation to Japan. In Chapter 4, it does this through first examining how Ezo came to be understood as a space bound off from the rest of Japan. This was partially constituted through a historical understanding of an unknown region populated by a barbarian peoples, which began to acquire definition at the outset of the Tokugawa era. However, the actual operation of a barrier between two areas, known as Matsumae and Ezo, was the outcome of local administrative requirements. These partially stemmed from the wider political structure within which the Matsumae were incorporated, but also reflected the specifics of their frontier situation. This border aided Matsumae claims to both authority and knowledge of its lands. As has long been argued, this border came to function as a strictly demarcated indication of status in the domain. However, while the ascription of status was not really based upon geography, the structure of rule necessitated the assertion of a geographic division. Although the border did not function as an effective means of separating or controlling the movement of population, this was nevertheless how it came to represented on the map. In doing so, it served the same functional role as the borders that were examined in the previous chapter. Chapter 5 highlights how the structuring effect of the border\u2019s authority also operated at the national scale, representing the Matsumae\u2019s administrative boundary as a national border filtering the movement of people and goods across it. Through the expansion of Japanese trade in the region, the space of Ezo came to be reconstituted as a series of places on the coast accessible from Matsumae, granting its geography official representation upon the maps of the state. This was in accordance with a number of other means through which the Matsumae sought to assert their place within the Tokugawa order. This meant that although the Matsumae stood outside the normative framework used for mapping the rest of Tokugawa Japan, as detailed in Chapter 2, its representation of the Ezo came to be assimilated onto the map of the state. However, their land was only made commensurable with that of elsewhere in Japan following the return of Matsumae and Ezo to the family after 1821, when the extent of their lands had been reauthorized by its return to them from the state. This sanction allowed for the incorporation of this commensurably different space within the map of Japan. Chapter 6 examines how the invocation of this border was incorporated into understandings about Japan\u2019s place in the world. Seen from Edo, and although ruled by the Matsumae, Ezo represented an exotic and distant land, about which little was understood. As such, however, over the course of the eighteenth century, the lands of the Ezo would come to be familiarized as demarcating the edges of Japan, providing the uncivilized other against which Japan was able to map itself. This was able to be achieved through emphasizing not only the Ezo\u2019s distance from Japan, but links with them, through a reinterpretation of China\u2019s tributary system to explain trade being conducted at Japan\u2019s frontiers. While this allowed for the incorporation of Ezo land on the map, however, it maintained a civilizational distance from the rest of Japan. This would only be overcome through the introduction of agriculture in Ezo, which was a project that only came to fruition after the Meiji Restoration. The understanding of Ezo that came to circulate within Japan came to be reflected back in Ezo itself, and ultimately how it was that the space of Ezo came to be delineated and incorporated into Japan in the nineteenth century as Hokkaido. The Part as a whole indicates how this Ezo territory was created in relation to that of the rest of Japan, which served to create the coordinates within which the Japanese idea of Ezo was understood. While Part 2 relates the constitution of Ezo territory primarily with Japan, Part 3 seeks to account for how Ezo came to acquire territorial definition on the world\u2019s map. Chapter 7 traces out how the region of Ezo came to represented and demarcated on European maps and within geographical texts of the period, and how these materials were subsequently reincorporated within Japan\u2019s own map of Ezo space. European accounts of the sixteenth and seventeenth century relied on a limited body of information about the region. Nevertheless, while Japanese were able to abstract Ezo space in order to position it solely in relation to its own national body, in Europe the extent location of Ezo was an issue bound up with other places, relations between which had to be adjusted and represented on the map. European speculation about Ezo\u2019s place in the world would find its way back to Japan, where it would come to unsettle the formerly fixed place of Ezo on the map. This destabilization occurred in the context of fears of the threat from Russia, whose presence came to be known around the same time. As a result, Ezo came to be reinterpreted within a wider geopolitical context within Japan, a context that unsettled the actual shape of the land represented upon the map. Chapter 8 looks at the way this reincorporation encouraged a new attention to Ezo\u2019s extent, one which resulted in the representation of this space of Ezo, and a reinterpretation of the meaning ascribed to the borders in the region. This was done through a close attention to the geography of the region itself, which came to be the object of repeated investigation by both Japanese and foreign parties. Both groups were engaged in the same process of trying to make the space of Ezo commensurable with that of elsewhere on the world map, through an extensive process of geographical and cartographic exchange that served to bring the world to Ezo itself.

Fish oil and purified n-3 PUFA supplementations have certainly emerged on the conscious level of the Western consumer by intense advertising, both for prescription supplements (e.g., Lovaza fish oil) and over-the-counter fish oil products and related biological extracts. In large part, interest in these products stems from the promise of potential health benefits when the ratio of n-6 esters (linoleate and arachidonate) to n-3 esters (EPA and DHA) is lowered, which results in the reduction in the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory, n-6 derived, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Adding to the favorable reduction of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators has been the discovery of EPA and DHA metabolites with properties of enhancing the resolution of inflammation in an active fashion (2). These novel lipids have been termed \u201cspecialized pro-resolving mediators\u201d (SPMs) and a large number of such biologically active products have now been chemically described, including protectin D1 (2), protectin DX (3), maresin 1 (2), resolvin D1 (2), and resolvin E1 (2) (Fig. 1). Studies of the biosynthesis, pharmacologic activity, and measurement of these products in cellular models has driven interest in this area, leading to the question being asked: Can the biosynthesis of one or more of these SPMs be enhanced in vivo as a result of n-3 PUFA dietary supplementation? \n \n \n \nFig. 1. \n \nChemical structures and stereochemistry of pro-resolution metabolites of EPA and DHA. These are some of the major SPMs that have been described. \n \n \n \nEffects of n-3 fatty acid supplements on cardiovascular disease were first popularized by studies in Greenland Eskimos several decades ago, which launched hundreds of clinical studies of the effect of an enriched fish oil diet on various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, dermatological disorders, and cancer, to name just a few (4). Today, this area remains somewhat cloudy, controversial, but economically healthy (http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/claims-that-fish-oil-boosts-health-linger-despite-science-saying-the-opposite/2015/07/08/db7567d2-1848-11e5-bd7f-4611a60dd8e5_story.html). \n \nIt has been surprisingly difficult to demonstrate a clear and significant benefit of increasing n-3 fatty acids in the diet, including reduction of disease symptoms related to inflammation and postulated to involve n-6 inflammatory mediators. The Journal has been an active participant in reporting results from several human subject studies addressing this topic. Some of these reports are at odds with each other, including the point of whether or not SPMs can be detected in the plasma of subjects with enhanced dietary n-3 fatty acid esters intake. There have been reports in the Journal of the detection and quantitation of certain SPMs in blood as well as reports that SPMs cannot be detected in plasma. In a very important part of their study, the Penn group carried out the clinical maneuver of an inflammatory challenge and using doses of fish oil sufficiently high to influence blood pressure and platelet function (and much higher than usually consumed as a health supplement) but failed to find SPMs in plasma. Interestingly, measurements by both sides of this controversy have been made using sophisticated tandem mass spectrometry as the analytical platform to increase specificity and sensitivity for detection of SPMs (LC-MS/MS targeted strategies). \n \nThe analytical results and conclusions that have been reached by these studies are at odds with each other as illustrated by recent reports from the University of Western Australia (5, 6), where levels of these SPMs were detected close to the analytical detection limit and from the Penn group (1) that could not find specific SPMs. In general, these papers used very similar approaches of targeted LC-MS/MS, but there are sufficient differences between the two approaches to make it difficult to assess which one is valid. Perhaps both are correct? There are inherent challenges illustrated by these studies when measuring lipids, even with state-of-the-art mass spectrometric equipment at these very trace levels in a complex biological matrix such as plasma. A distinct advantage of the Penn group\u2019s approach was the availability of deuterated standards for all SPMs to precisely indicate LC elution of each target molecule as well as the ability to calculate precise extraction efficiency for each of the target SPMs in plasma. The University of Western Australia only had one internal standard in their LC-MS/MS targeted assays and this internal standard was not an SPM. In any event, the controversy remains as to whether these SPMs are detectable in plasma and as a corollary, whether they do or do not change as a result of n-3 fatty acid dietary supplementation. Development of higher sensitivity as well as ancillary specificity in mass spectrometry should add considerably to clarify this important issue. \n \nAnother recent patient-oriented study of EPA and DHA supplementation published in the Journal (7), also failed to observe resolvins E or D in plasma. However, this group from Berlin did identify a family of metabolites in plasma derived from the cytochrome P450 pathway of metabolism of EPA and DHA. Arachidonate metabolites derived from the CYP-epoxygenase pathway are known to be bioactive, but little is known about the EPA- and DHA-derived epoxides or their diol products that result from epoxide hydrolysis. Interestingly, the majority of these EPA and DHA epoxides (90%) were found as esterified products in plasma that were released upon base hydrolysis (7). The Penn group also found significant elevation of the most abundant of these CYP-epoxygenase products identified by the Berlin group as 17(18)-EpETE (Fig. 1) and 19(20)-EpDoPE. The Berlin group used abbreviation 17,18-EEQ and 19,20-EDP for these same compounds. These products might turn out to be the best indicators of n-3 fatty acid supplementation in plasma and interestingly, anti-inflammatory activity has been described for these epoxides (8). \n \nOne positive lead presented in this report from the Penn group was that urinary metabolites of these SPMs might be detected and therefore serve as relevant markers to indicate in vivo biosynthesis. This strategy of using urinary metabolites was established many years ago in eicosanoid biochemistry and is an accepted method by which to address both leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis in animals and human subjects. In fact, it was the measurement of a prostacyclin metabolite excreted into the urine that was used to assess the potential cardiovascular risk inherent in the COX-2 inhibitors (9). This discovery about COX-2 inhibitors was made by this Penn group. We will look forward to improvements in the analytical methodology and approach in order to address these important issues of the role of DHA and EPA in regulating the resolution of inflammation in various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, by the formation of SPMs.", "authors": ["R.

We describe a prediction model that relies on using implicit social shared viewing behavior such as how many times a video was paused, rewound, or fast-forwarded as well as the duration of the session. Finally, we present some new directions for future virality research and for the design of future social media tools. Increasingly, more and more media is watched and shared online. Websites such as YouTube, enables people to not just share videos but socially interact with each other as well. More recently, newer social media systems allow users to synchronously interact with each other and share videos simultaneously. These real-time interactions leave behind large amounts of contextual usage data that, we believe, are reflective of the deeper and more connected social interaction that accompanies synchronous content sharing.

There was wide variation across all respondents with regard to accurate knowledge of PNG's abortion laws, and to views on the provision of safe accessible abortion services in the country's public health system.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAbortion training for service providers and provision of primary care services are necessary to ensure that PNG women have equitable access to abortion care instead of seeking out untrained providers or attempting self-abortion. Innovative approaches also need to be adopted to complement family planning efforts in PNG.", "authors": ["Francisca Kopunye", "G. Mola", "Cindy E. Woods", "C.

Almost half of the state's clinics had closed by April 2014, and there was a 13% decline in abortions in the 6 months after the first portions of the law went into effect, compared to the same period 1 year prior. We aimed to describe women's experiences seeking abortion care shortly after clinics closed and document pregnancy outcomes of women affected by these closures.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nBetween November 2013 and November 2014, we recruited women who sought abortion care at Texas clinics that were no longer providing services. Some participants had appointments scheduled at clinics that stopped offering care when the law went into effect; others called seeking care at clinics that had closed. Texas resident women seeking abortion in Albuquerque, New Mexico, were also recruited.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe conducted 23 in-depth interviews and performed a thematic analysis. As a result of clinic closures, women experienced confusion about where to go for abortion services, and most reported increased cost and travel time to obtain care. Having to travel farther for care also compromised their privacy. Eight women were delayed more than 1 week, two did not receive care until they were more than 12 weeks pregnant and two did not obtain their desired abortion at all. Five women considered self-inducing the abortion, but none attempted this.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe clinic closures resulted in multiple barriers to care, leading to delayed abortion care for some and preventing others from having the abortion they wanted.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nThe restrictions on abortion facilities that resulted in the closure of clinics in Texas created significant burdens on women that prevented them from having desired abortions.

The word \u201cliberal\u201d has shifted meaning, another trait of language, since meaning exists in the minds of users, not in some protected, never-changing space or form. In the majority of Americans\u2019 minds, \u201cliberal\u201d has become associated with specific political positions rather than a form of government in general. To most people \u201cprogressive\u201d sounds better, although an historian could argue the word is technically being used incorrectly. It doesn\u2019t matter, because a word doesn\u2019t \u201chave\u201d meaning; meaning exists in the minds of people using the word. If \u201cprogressive\u201d hits people and evokes or stirs up ideas of forward-thinking, young, active, problemsolving people, then good. For most people it doesn\u2019t bring up pictures of Woodrow Wilson and suffragists. These examples bring up another issue with language: words change meaning over time, or more specifically, the meaning we attached to them changes. \u201cPretty\u201d used to mean \u201cclever\u201d 250 years ago. \u201cPrevent\u201d meant to \u201cprecede,\u201d not to keep from happening. Language is simply not static, as much as we might like it to be. One of the main reasons we find Shakespeare daunting is that so many of the Elizabethan words either no longer are used or they have changed meanings. With regard to the use of language for power, even unknowingly, feminists in the 1970s argued that the common way we use English language was biased against women. King-sized means \u201cbig and powerful,\u201d but \u201cqueensized\u201d means \u201cfor overweight women.\u201d \u201cMaster\u201d was not equivalent to \u201cmistress.\u201d \u201cMadame\u201d had taken on a bad connotation, even though it should have been equivalent to \u201csir.\u201d Many words referring to women had to add a suffix that was often \u201cless than,\u201d such as \u201c-ess\u201d or \u201c-ette\u201d or \u201cco-ed.\u201d In the last thirty years we have gotten away from that, so that you often hear a female actor referred to as \u201cactor\u201d rather than \u201cactress,\u201d but old habits die hard. We see another example of power in language in the abortion debate. Prior to 1973, abortions could be obtained legally, to some extent, in three states: California, New York, and Hawaii. After the Roe v. Wade decision in January of 1973, they could, at least theoretically, be obtained in all fifty states. Roe v. Wade did not make abortions legal so much as it made anti-abortion laws illegal or unconstitutional, so the effect was generally the same. The people who were against abortion were now on the defensive, and they had to start fighting. It\u2019s generally better to be \u201cpro-\u201dsomething rather than \u201canti-\u201dsomething, so they became \u201cpro-life.\u201d Those favoring abortion rights then automatically became \u201cpro-death.\u201d One side had defined the terms of the debate, and the other had to come up with something comparable. \u201cPro-choice\u201d takes advantage of the American belief in capitalism and freedoms. These examples show how \u201cdefining the terms\u201d gives a person control of the discourse. As you progress as a public speaker, you will become more aware of the power certain words have over audiences. An ethical communicator will use language in a way that encourages respect for others, freedom of thought, and informed decision making. First, however, a speaker should seek to meet the standards of clarity, effectiveness, appropriateness, and elegance in language, which are discussed in the next section. Standards for Language in Public Speaking Clear language is powerful language. Clarity is the first concern of a public speaker when it comes to choosing how to phrase the ideas of his or her speech. If you are not clear, specific, precise, detailed, and sensory with your language, you won\u2019t have to worry about being emotional or persuasive, because you won\u2019t be understood.

The online database contains comprehensive information on the abortion laws, policies, health standards and guidelines for WHO and United Nations (UN) Member States. It is intended for use by policy-makers, human rights bodies, nongovernmental organizations, public health researchers and civil society. The database is designed to further strengthen global and national efforts to eliminate unsafe abortion by facilitating comparative and country-specific analyses of abortion laws and policies, placing them in the context of information and recommendations from WHO technical and policy guidance on safe abortion. (1,2) The main objectives of the database are to promote greater transparency of abortion laws and policies and State accountability for the protection of women and girls' health and human rights. Backdrop to abortion policies The association between restrictive abortion laws and unsafe abortion has been well documented. (3,4) According to an analysis by UN DESA, the average rate of unsafe abortion is estimated to be more than four times higher in countries with more restrictive abortion laws than in countries with less restrictive laws. (5) Restrictive abortion laws are also associated with higher levels of maternal mortality. The average maternal mortality ratio is three times higher in countries with more restrictive abortion laws (223 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births) compared to countries with less restrictive laws (77 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births). (5) Restrictive legal grounds for abortion are only one of many policy barriers that affect women and girls' access to safe abortion. Other barriers include policies that limit provision of abortion care to obstetricians and gynaecologists working at high-level care facilities; conscientious objection by health-care providers; requirements for third-party authorization(s); unnecessary medical tests; mandatory counselling; and mandatory waiting periods. (1) Restrictive abortion laws and policies create risks to women and girls' health by deterring them from seeking care and hindering providers from delivering services within the formal health system. (1) Such laws and policies cause delays for women receiving care by creating complex and burdensome administrative procedures, increasing the costs of safe abortion services and limiting the availability of services and their equitable sociogeographic distribution. (1) Such delays can also result in pregnancy advancing beyond legally allowed gestational limits, thus making women ineligible to receive safe services. (1) Restrictions on access to safe abortion create inequalities both within and between countries, making access to safe abortion a privilege of the rich and leaving poor women little choice but to resort to illegal and usually unsafe practices and providers. (1) Consensus to eliminate unsafe abortion WHO first recognized unsafe abortion as a serious public health problem in 1967. (6) The problem was reaffirmed in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994, which underscored the need for States to address the health consequences of unsafe abortion and to provide safe abortion where it is not against the law.

In February 2016, a new law came into effect, which prohibits the state from contracting health services with any organisation that performs or promotes abortion. This law blocks funding of organisations such as Planned Parenthood from receiving state funds for activities related to HIV and STD testing and sexual education. Methods We are conducting a rigorous evaluation of the sexual and reproductive health-related consequences of the new law. In an ecologic analysis of state- and county-level data from Ohio for 2015 and 2016, we will compare trends in prevalence of HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhoea (all nationally notifiable conditions) before and after the implementation of the2016 law. We will examine trends by several characteristics, including sex, race/ethnicity, age, education level, insurance status (Ohio is a Medicaid-expansion state under the Affordable Care Act), sexual orientation, urban/rural residence, and other variables. To disentangle the effect of the law from secular trends in HIV/STD, we will compare Ohio\u2019s outcomes to the same outcomes in nearby Illinois. Illinois has similar population characteristics to Ohio but does not have the same legislative environment impacting allocation of funds for reproductive health services. Results Results will be available in summer 2017. In Ohio, we anticipate a decline in the number of HIV and STD tests performed in 2016 compared to 2015, and an increase in the prevalence of each disease in 2016 compared to 2015. We anticipate no meaningful changes in trends across years in Illinois. Conclusion Multiple states across the United States are considering legislation similar to Ohio\u2019s, to restrict the use of state and federal funding by clinical and community organisations that provide HIV/STD care alongside other sexual health services.

The criminalization of abortion forms an important part of the Islamist government\u2019s restrictive ideological stance on women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights generally. Sudan has not ratified any international or regional conventions protecting women\u2019s human rights. Abortion is a particularly sensitive area within maternal health and reproductive rights because it is mediated through the crime of zina (sexual intercourse before and outside of marriage). Sudan is unique in the MENA region, for pregnancy among unmarried women is considered sufficient evidence for the crime of zina as outlined in the 1991 Criminal Code.5 This enables a strong link between the crime of fornication and the crime of illegal abortion, which shapes politicization in peculiar ways. The prevailing sentiment among Sudan\u2019s Islamist officials is that the primary purpose of women is to marry and to produce children\u2014and as long as reproduction takes place within marriage, there is no need for abortion except under special circumstances. According to this view, only unmarried women who get pregnant illegally would seek abortion in order to \u201chide\u201d the evidence of fornication.6 The scarce available research on abortion in Sudan suggests that the high rate of unintended pregnancy, combined with the country\u2019s restrictive abortion law and social stigma, forces women to seek illegal and unsafe abortion, often in secrecy from their families.7 While women who can afford it are able to access safe illegal abortions in the private market (where they may purchase misoprostol), women with lower socioeconomic status must resort to unsafe illegal abortions, which can often lead to complications and the need to seek emergency care at public hospitals.8 Based on original data collected through fieldwork between 2011 and 2019, we have found that although abortion does not appear in the domestic political debate on women\u2019s reproductive and maternal health and is not on the agenda of the Sudanese women\u2019s movement, it is politicized in the implementation of the law. We understand politicization as the politically contested implementation of a law. Our findings indicate that bureaucratic barriers and policies prevent and deter illegal abortion, which is politically and socially viewed as intrinsically linked to illegal pregnancy. These barriers, which contravene women\u2019s human rights to health, dignity, and security, are found primarily in public hospitals, where there is an increased police presence outside maternity and emergency wards. Thus, unmarried women in search of lifesaving treatment find themselves under surveillance the minute they enter a hospital building unaccompanied by a male guardian. The women who seek emergency medical care because of complications after an illegal abortion are at the mercy of doctors in terms of whether they will be reported to the police. We coined the term \u201cHippocratic disobedience\u201d to capture the subtle and often hidden ways in which Sudanese doctors disobey state policies to protect a vulnerable group of unmarried women from prosecution. They do so at great personal risk, and often against their own personal beliefs that abortion is haram (forbidden) in Islam and that fornication is morally wrong. Data collection and methods We conducted a qualitative interview-based study in Sudan\u2019s capital. In total, we conducted 37 semi-structured interviews with a variety of stakeholders in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019.

From there, we carefully snowballed by using central gatekeepers with whom we have gained trust. We interviewed international donors, medical doctors and midwives in public and private hospitals and medical universities, women\u2019s rights activists, politicians, family and child protection units, journalists, and religious scholars. Thirty-three of the interviews were conducted in person in Khartoum, and four were conducted by email. Twenty-eight of these interviews were conducted in English, and five were conducted in Arabic and later translated into English. We personally conducted all interviews. The interviews varied from half an hour to one and a half hours. Because of the sensitivity of the topic, we did not record the interviews, instead taking elaborate notes. All interviewees gave their oral consent to be interviewed. All interviewees remain anonymous. The majority of those interviewed are medical doctors who are currently working or have recently worked in public hospitals. The sample of medical doctors is somewhat skewed, as we have been unable to reach the outliers, whether those who perform abortions illegally or those who are adamant about reporting illegal pregnancies to the police. Most of the data collected for this article was gathered in 2018 and 2019 as part of the project \u201cPolitical Determinants of Sexual and Reproductive Health: Criminalization, Health Impacts and Game Changers.\u201d The project investigates the health effects of criminalizing sexual and reproductive behavior and health services, and analyzes the political dynamics that drive, hamper, and shape the uses of such criminal law in nine African countries, including predominantly Christian sub-Saharan countries (Uganda, Malawi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Zambia, and South Africa) and North African Muslim countries (Sudan and Tunisia). Ethical approval for this research was obtained from the Norwegian Center for Research Data (approval number 60055). All interviews were conducted before the fall of President Omar alBashir in April 2019. A peaceful popular uprising, which started in December 2018 with doctors and other professionals going on strike, ousted Bashir, who had ruled Sudan since a military coup d\u2019etat in 1989. Some of his key supporters within the military remain in central positions as Sudan now navigates a transition to civilian government. The study relies heavily on interview data, but we also triangulate our analysis with other data sources, such as legal texts, government health plans and policies, and media reports. Women\u2019s reproductive rights and policy in Sudan There has been an intensified focus by Sudan\u2019s Islamist government on reducing the country\u2019s maternal mortality rate, which is currently estimated at 295 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.9 However, huge urban-rural disparities exist. The emergency obstetric and neonatal care needed to save lives is weak, and the Sudanese health system is persistently underfunded.10 Sudan experienced a significant reduction in its maternal mortality rate in 2011, when South Sudan separated from the north and became the country with the world\u2019s highest maternal mortality rate. Direct obstetric causes contribute to 60% of maternal deaths in Sudan. This high prevalence is associated with many risk factors, including female genital mutilation/ cutting (FGM/C), early childbearing, high fertility, and barriers to accessing maternal health services.11 In recent years, women\u2019s reproductive health and rights have received height", "authors": ["Irene Maffi", "Liv T\u00f8nnessen"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2019}, "8": {"title": "Book review: Padres y madres corresponsables.

It is also a prosopography of many of the hundreds of U.S. Navy sailors and marines who lived there after long careers of active service. The beautiful hardcover package includes a lavish illustration of the asylum in the endpapers. In its beautiful endpapers, as well as the institutional history part of the book, Ungentle Goodnights evokes histories of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The prosopographical parts of the book are a \u201cnew military history\u201d look at the lives of ordinary men who served in the U.S. Navy of the early American republic. McKee uses records from the National Archives and the U.S. Naval Academy\u2019s Nimitz library to track down stories of the 541 men, sailors or marines, who entered the U.S. Naval Asylum between 1831 and 1865. Three quarters of these men died at the asylum. After the first four chapters, on which more later, each chapter centers around a theme and tells the story of a handful of the Asylum\u2019s \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d whose lives relate to that theme. Themes include work at the Asylum, mental illness, alcoholism, discipline, departure from the Asylum, death, et cetera. McKee makes a case that tracing the lives of sailors and marines at the Asylum backwards from their time in the Asylum gives historians a better, more accurate understanding of the lived experiences of sailors and marines. He points out that sailors\u2019 autobiographies of the nineteenth century are liable to be either fake or exaggerated, and are in any case exceptional. The lives he focuses on, McKee argues, are more typical. Readers get a sense of what \u201cJack Tar\u2019s\u201d experience was in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Through individual stories, readers learn of a navy force that is surprisingly international, with many sailors born somewhere in northern Europe. McKee also notes a large number of beneficiaries from the Mid-Atlantic states, and a large number who came to the Navy after stints as farmers, tanners, or some other career. McKee returns often to the stereotype of the \u201cdrunken sailor,\u201d finding that alcoholism was rampant among inmates at the Asylum. At", "authors": ["Gabriel J.

The chapter concludes by recounting the death of Eliza Ann, which left Eliza as the primary caregiver for her four grandchildren. Similar themes are pursued in the closing chapter, \u201cNorth American Grandmother,\u201d which addresses Eliza\u2019s decision to emigrate to Canada and the teaching and pedagogy that lay at the heart of her new seminary for young ladies in Niagara. Much of the chapter explores the challenges Eliza faced from her grandsons Tom and Will, who were prone to fits and excessive drinking and died in the boating accident that forms the opening vignette of this book. There are a number of strengths to this well-researched and coherently argued biography, which provides non-specialist readers with an accessible and comprehensive overview of Fenwick\u2019s life, as well as an understanding of the wider cultural, intellectual, and political contexts that informed her experiences, ideas, and writings. Eliza\u2019s story has been pieced together through careful archival research, and there is a strong awareness that this is not just a story about a single individual, but one of complex interpersonal connections and hierarchies of dependency. The major criticism that can be levelled at this book is Paul\u2019s own authorial bias. Indeed, she writes from a position of considerable admiration and sympathy for Eliza Fenwick. As a result, places in the narrative sometimes obscure as much as enlighten. Fenwick\u2019s relationships with William Godwin and Mary Robinson, for instance, are presented in chapter 3 as positive and mutually reinforcing, when it is likely that these connections were fraught and contested. Indeed, there is a tendency to overplay Eliza\u2019s agency within her networks, when it seems that some of her relationships were exploitative, rather than supportive, like when Eliza worked as a shopkeeper for William Godwin (97). A similar scenario is present in the depiction of Eliza\u2019s friendship with Mary Hays. Paul suggests that the reason for the tension in their relationship was because Eliza was a mother and Hays was not, rendering their relationship awkward (90). This conjecture feels more speculative than evidential, and it would have been useful for the author to have probed the nature of their friendship further. A similar point might be made regarding the ambiguous treatment of friendship and networking throughout the book, especially in chapters 3 and 4. Whereas Paul makes a convincing case for viewing Eliza as a woman able to establish a successful life for herself and her family through her ability to cultivate and consolidate a useful network of friends, there is little engagement with the concept of networking. It would have been beneficial for the author to have explored what being a networker meant in an eighteenthand nineteenth-century sense, and how Eliza\u2019s own ability to network differed from that of other women in this period. For example, in chapter 4, it is unclear who made up Eliza\u2019s networks and exactly what they did to support her and her daughter, Eliza Ann. This volume is intended to be for \u201cthe general interested reader,\u201d rather than specialists. Paul acknowledges in her opening notes that the narrative makes use of anachronism \u201cto capture a feeling or an idea from the past\u201d (xvii). A sense of this is provided in the title, Early Modern Feminist, which is certainly not a world outlook to which Eliza or her female acquaintances would have ascribed. Paul defends her rationale for taking this approach, but there are places where examples of presentism sit uneasily and disrupt, rather the enhance, the narrative. For example, Paul compares Methodist itinerants to rock stars performing at Glastonbury and Woodstock (29). Paul also interprets a number of moments in Eliza\u2019s life reading in a cinematic format, with frames, stills and montages, which are discordant with the evidence being presented (5, 133\u201334, 175). Despite these problems, this is generally a successful book. It is particularly adept at interweaving history, literature, and political thought into a singular narrative, and it makes a persuasive case for viewing women as important intellectual and literary figures, even if they were not politically active or established authors. Most important, it is entirely successful in showing why Eliza\u2019s story is worth telling and why scholars of the future should take more of an interest in her life, writings, and experiences. As an accessible and engaging introduction to this topic, it opens up a range of ways for understanding the possibilities open to independent women seeking to make a life for themselves in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century British Atlantic world.", "authors": ["M.

Pasted on to each page of the leather-bound Volume 40 of the Rush Family Papers are sheets of writing that Fergusson sent to Benjamin Rush during the final decades of the eighteenth century, including her poetry and personal letters to Rush, transcriptions of letters from her other correspondents, excerpts from newspaper articles, and passages from several literary works by other authors. The earliest letter in the volume is dated April 14, 1772 and the latest is a memorandum Fergusson sent Rush on April 23, 1800, ten months before she died on February 23, 1801. The letters in between contain material that Fergusson originally composed as far back as the 1750s as well as poems that she wrote in the 1780s and 1790s. Though we can page through Fergusson\u2019s writing, we cannot know who assembled it. Archivists at the Library Company assembled the volume from materials in a folder that James Rush, Benjamin\u2019s youngest child, donated to the library; James had obtained the folder from his brother Richard, who had received it from their father Benjamin. We can speculate that the archivists at the Library Company who put together the volume followed the order of the materials in the folder which contained them when donated to the library. Yet, as this list of actors shows, we will never know what the original order was and, indeed, if there was an order which Fergusson wanted to give to the work she sent to her friend. The volume\u2019s semi-chronological order, however, tells a particular story. In the letter that opens the volume, Elizabeth Graeme informs Rush that she has decided to marry Henry Fergusson, to whom Rush had introduced her a few months earlier, despite her father\u2019s disapproval. Soon after this letter, the reader finds what looks like a memorandum for the archivists in James Rush\u2019s handwriting that ambiguously refers to Elizabeth Graeme and Henry Fergusson\u2019s marriage and to the volume\u2019s content: \u201cMrs. Eliza Fergusson a lady great in her day in Philad a sort of litterary gossip who botherd my", "authors": ["Chiara Cillerai"], "citations": 0, "venue": "Women's Studies", "year": 2021}, "3": {"title": "Standing Firmly by the Flag: Nebraska Territory and the Civil War, 1861\u20131867 by James E.

Th e First Nebraska\u2019s story (the unit fought Indians in western Nebraska as well as in the battles of Forts Donelson, Henry, and Shiloh) is not a new one for Potter. In 2007 he published, along with Edith Robbins, the diary and letters of Private August Scherneckau, a German immigrant who served in the First Nebraska Volunteers from 1862 to 1865.

This is how one pictures the angel of history, Benjamin observed: His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing in from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such a violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress. (1) Benjamin's angel is a familiar figure to scholars of the philosophy of history. But it is a far cry from the stories that modern medicine typically tells about itself, in which new discoveries tame ancient scourges and promise increasing precision in both diagnosis and cure. As Leslie and colleagues report, however, there are risks to assuming that progress in biomedical knowledge is inherently cumulative (2). The authors have compiled a disturbing tale of historical amnesia in which the neglect of 19th- and 20th-century information led to preventable adverse events in 21st-century patients. This was no secret tucked away in a dusty archive or a rare book room; it was published in top-tier medical journals of the 20th century. The information in question regards the propensity of sodiumglucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors to lead to life-threatening ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Readers of 21st-century medical literature learned this fact in a pronouncement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 15 May 2015, after use of recently approved SGLT2 inhibitors led to serious adverse events in American patients. But this discovery, the authors argue, could have been visible to anyone who researched the literature on this family of drugs from before 1950 (3). Contemporary SGLT2 inhibitors are derivatives of phlorizin, a drug that had already been described in the late 19th century to have ketogenic properties that could lead to acidosis; further reports appeared in mainstream English-language journals between 1914 and 1944including the Journal of the American Medical Association, Endocrinology, and the American Journal of Physiology. Only 6 weeks after the 2013 approval of canagliflozin, the first new SGLT2 inhibitor in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System received its first report of ketoacidosis. In the 2 years between this first event and the formal announcement, more than 150 patients had drug-associated ketoacidosis; most cases required hospitalization, and several were life-threatening. Why did a dangerous side effect known to diabetologists of the 19th and early 20th centuries need to be discovered by a 21st-century regulatory body only after 2 years and more than 150 injured patients? Leslie and colleagues explore many moments in which researchers, manufacturers, and regulators could have come across this information via a detailed literature review, had they known to look for it. The story of SGLT2 inhibitor ketoacidosis, Leslie and colleagues conclude, illustrates how the drug approval process should incorporate historical inquiry (2). Sadly, this is not the only case of drug development in which lack of historical investigation led to preventable morbidity and mortality. Many readers of Annals of Internal Medicine will recall the tragedy of Ellen Roche, a healthy volunteer who died of lung failure less than a month after inhaling an experimental new formulation of hexamethonium in 2001 (4). The lead investigator on the trial had done a standard PubMed search on hexamethonium and looked at references in current textbooks when investigating possible harms of the drug. But this approach missed a series of prominent reports of hexamethonium's pulmonary toxicity in mainstream medical journals of the 1950s (5). In part, this is a problem of the media of medical informatics: Few researchers are aware that MEDLARS, the first digital predecessor of PubMed, began to computerize medical literature only in 1963 and is far less comprehensive in its coverage of articles published before then. Other indexes (some of which are still bound in paper) can serve as more reliable guides (6). To a larger extent, however, this lapse is also a reminder of a pervasive historical naivet on the part of researchers, manufacturers, and regulators charged with the task of new drug development. Wrapped up in a quest to produce 21st-century cures, these actors are rarely encouraged to pause and ask when they might be repeating 20th-century toxicities, discovering what is already known of the harms of older substances to the human frame. Knowledge does not just accumulate. It is forgotten and erased all the time. This is not always a bad thing, as the historian Robert Proctor and philosopher of science Londa Schiebinger have noted (7): Some forms of knowledge, like the medical techniques that assist human torture, are perhaps better forgotten. But when published data with the capacity to prevent needless morbidity and mortality are overlooked because of inattention to articles from more than a few decades ago, we should be rightly concerned. Proctor and Schiebinger argue that a new science of agnotology (etymologically, the study of ignorance) is urgently needed to understand how these forms of pernicious amnesia take place (7). Benjamin would not have been surprised. Elsewhere in the aforementioned essay, he observed that Every image of the past that is not recognized by the present as one of its own concerns threatens to disappear irretrievably (1). Leslie and colleagues ask us to weigh the costs of these disappearances and to identify what paths we might take to ensure that their histories better become our concerns moving forward.

ISBN 978-0-8101-2652-7.This novel tells a story of Bernhard Schmidt. In the history of astronomy Schmidt (1879-1935) is best known as the inventor of the Schmidt camera that provoked a revolution in stellar optics. An instrument maker, he was bom in Estonia (at that time part of Czarist Russia) but lived most of his life in Germany - in Mittweida and later in Hamburg - and died there. During his working life he polished lenses for astronomical telescopes but also fulfilled other roles in the maintenance of mechanical and optical instruments. In 1930 he invented the famous Schmidt-camera, but died before he could see the full success of his invention. The world was moving towards war and stellar optics was not the first priority in astronomy.Several key factors shaped the life of Bernhard Schmidt. First, he was from Naissaar, a small island near Tallinn - so he was a foreigner even in the capital. He might well have become a fisherman or a pilot, as had been his father and grandfathers. Second, his destiny was turned when he lost his right hand in a teenage accident with gunpowder. That disability gave him problems socially, but also forced Schmidt to develop his left hand to a sensitivity and exactness that was almost legendary. A third key factor in the life of Bernhard Schmidt was that he was largely self-taught; he received his education from the Mittweida Technical School and was always proud to be more of an artist than scientist. A fourth key factor, especially emphasized in the novel, was his Estonian origin. Despite the fact that the language of his education was German, the minority upper-class language in the Estonian territory until the end of the nineteenth century, we know that Bernhard Schmidt never forgot Estonian, for in the Observatory of Tartu Archives there is a 1926 letter written by him in Estonian.The author of the novel, Jaan Kross (1920-2007), is one of the most important Estonian writers of the second half of the twentieth century. His books about famous, or neglected but important, historical figures helped in their fictional form to keep free his readers' minds in occupied Estonia. In the introduction the translator writes: \"In 1987, when Sailing Against the Wind was first published in what was then the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, it was by no means certain that Estonia would emerge relatively unscathed from the ruins of the Soviet Union; the monolith collapsed only a few years later\" (p. xi).In this multilayer novel there are of course many hidden messages; parallels between Nazi Germany and the Soviet system could not remain unnoticed by Soviet readers. \u2026", "authors": ["Lea Leppik"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2014}, "6": {"title": "Murder on Shades Mountain: The Legal Lynching of Willie Peterson and the Struggle for Justice in Jim Crow Birmingham by Melanie S. Morrison (review)", "abstract": "This book tells the little-known story of Willie Peterson, an African American veteran who was wrongly convicted of murdering two white women (and attempting to murder a third) in Depression-era Birmingham, Alabama. The case mirrors that of the Scottsboro Boys\u2014which occurred only fivemonths earlier in a nearby rural county\u2014in many ways: it involved a black man who was accused of assaulting white women; it galvanized white southern mobs and stoked fears of communism; it became a national cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre; the NAACP and the International Labor Defense (ILD) vied for control; and, of course, a similar miscarriage of justice ultimately prevailed. Yet the differences are also notable: the women were from affluent families; Walter White and the NAACP learned from Scottsboro and ultimately pushed aside the ILD and took charge of Peterson\u2019s defense; and amazingly, in the first trial, an all-white jury could not reach a unanimous decision of guilt, resulting in a mistrial. Peterson was, however, found guilty in the second trial and sentenced to death. This sentence prompted years of protest by African Americans and communists that ultimately pushed the governor of Alabama to commute Peterson\u2019s sentence to life imprisonment in 1934. Peterson, long riddled by tuberculosis, nevertheless died in prison only six years later. In casting light on this neglected story, Melanie S. Morrison succeeds admirably in moving the literature beyond Scottsboro, which has garnered the lion\u2019s share of historians\u2019 attention. Morrison is at her best when she unearths legal records to explain how the criminal justice system was stacked against Peterson. Over the course of twenty-two brief chapters, she documents police officers\u2019 malicious interrogation tactics, judges\u2019 outright bias and hostility, the power of public pressure to shape legal proceedings, and the ever-important role of money in securing a proper defense. In Morrison\u2019s hands, the Jim Crow justice system avoids caricature and emerges as a living, breathing system in which injustice is that much more evident and pernicious. Yet Murder on Shades Mountain: The Legal Lynching of Willie Peterson and the Struggle for Justice in Jim Crow Birmingham will likely frustrate historians and other scholars reading this journal. The book is a narrative history that rarely pauses to analyze or explain the larger historical significance. The scholarly reader is interested not merely in what happened, but also in why it matters and how it relates to other scholarship. The narrative approach employed here minimizes those discussions and leaves the reader wanting. Furthermore, Morrison\u2014not a historian by training\u2014relies above all on newspapers to weave the story together, making the book a bit light on archival research and secondary sources. Endnotes span only twenty-three pages. The result is that Morrison does not contextualize the Peterson case as fully as she might have or adequately connect it to historiographical debates. She does, near the end of the book, rightly suggest that the Peterson case reveals a longer history of the black civil rights struggle. But that thought is not developed, and the wide literature on that subject is not referenced. 200 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY", "authors": ["David A.

Mountain and heritage site of Potos\u00ed (Bolivia), 1545\u2013 2018. And, as if those projects were not enough to keep this prodigious researcher occupied for decades at a time, Tom had started a new research project on a Spanish wine-growing region that recovered its \u2018virtual commons\u2019 (sense of cultural heritage and locality) against the atomizing forces of the global economy. This astonishing new body of work is, if I may be allowed a pun, vintage Abercrombie. All three projects sit at the intersection of Anthropology, History, and Theory. His ethnographic work plumbs the cultural depths of his Andean and Spanish subjects, while his historical horizons encompass the trajectories of transatlantic journeys, Potos\u00ed\u2019s silver mining economy, and commodity capitalism over five centuries. And, in the grand tradition of the Chicago school of symbolic Anthropology, Tom\u2019s granular approach to his subjects was enriched by his deep immersion in theory and methodology.

Dropping his ethnographic anchor in the K\u2019ulta villages of rural Oruro, Tom set out to study how the Aymara-speaking people of that region understood and represented their collective past of oppression and survival under almost 500 years of Spanish colonialism and republican domination. The research journey took Tom into the field, where he began work by studying the K\u2019ulta\u2019s ritual forms of communal life and local statecraft. After a year or so in the field, Tom embarked on another year of archival research. What might have been a standard ethnography of Andean ritual life among the K\u2019ulta grew into a monumental ethnohistorical study that explored the reciprocal interplay between Andean and European traditions of power and memory in dynamic, power-laden contexts over almost 500 years of colonial and postcolonial domination.

In 2013, Mestrich acquired the adoption records of Joseph, a mixed-race child of Irish and Nigerian dissent who spent some of his childhood during the 1960s and '70s living with his impoverished Irish-born birth mother in London. This photobook is a combination of those adoption records, photographs, and images of objects saved by Joseph over the years, as well as contemporary images from Mestrich's own life. Mestrich was a speaker at the 2016 PhotoBookworks Symposium at Visual Studies Workshop. Perhaps Mestrich's drive for answers comes from her own unclear and undefined family history. Her previous projects, in which she explored her personal history, have opened her to connecting small, personal narratives to broader stories in American history. Obtaining the adoption papers for Joseph exposed her to a world she previously knew little about. In reading the records--which were recorded by social workers and therefore should have been clinical and objective--the viewer gains a sense of London at that time, including its racial climate. A recurring narrative of racism and xenophobia exists throughout the documents. The records are harsh concerningjoseph and his mother, Maureen. An image of what appears to be a news clipping advertising Joseph's adoption refers to him as having a handicap equivalent to \"mental retardation and physical disability\" because of his mixed race. In what appear to be the typed notes of a social worker, Maureen is referred to as having \"an unstable Irish temperament.\" For the most part, the text is a direct representation of the information available in the government files obtained by Mestrich. The text is manipulated poetically, repeating, changing size, and falling down the page in a way that allows it to reveal the characters of Joseph and Maureen. Mestrich references the archive through the use of a typewriter-style font and in copied, hand-written notations, but much of the archive's ephemera has been eliminated. Borders of the archival photographs, wrinkles in the papers, and signs of the papers' and photos' aging are gone from much of the text, allowing the reader to focus on the wording, as opposed to the appearance of the documents. The text is integral to the project, as it serves to build a bridge to current mixed-race orphans, connecting the archival narrative with contemporary stories. Removing archival ephemera helps to make the material timeless, as Joseph's story is one that could have been told about London mixed-race orphans from any modern decade. The combination of contemporary and archival imagery with timeless text allows the book to travel back and forth through time. The book is an amalgamation of three archives: the official archive, Joseph's archive, and Mestrich's personal archive. These collections work together, and sometimes in opposition to each other, to establish characters and a fluidity of time and space. The often harsh and judgmental text sits opposite an image of baby Joseph in a stroller, or Maureen reclining on a bed. In these two images, the archival ephemera remains, with tattered and taped edges serving as a visible reminder of both the past and of the fragility of the subjects of the images. Through this tender fragility, Maureen is given the voice and identity she was seemingly denied in the adoption archive. According to Mestrich, Maureen died in her early forties, when Joseph was only sixteen. By weaving together the three archives, the book becomes a considerate tribute that allows the viewer to gain comprehension, participating in the discovery of a person who was emotionally removed and difficult to understand.

Arvid Schors, a young historian at the University of Freiburg, has used all available evidence: documents from U.S. and other Western archives, volumes with both U.S. and Soviet documents, information in academic works by other authors, and memoirs by participants in the SALT process. The fact that he gains his insights mostly from U.S. sources inevitably results in asymmetries of content. The largely divergent approaches of politicians, diplomats, and scholars in the United States and their disagreements on aims and methods are discussed in great detail, in contrast to similar information on decision-making in Moscow, which is much sparser. In addition, the detailed insight on the negotiating processes is based largely on U.S. sources. Until August 2015, when vast quantities of important documents were made available at the Russian State Archive of Recent History, few Soviet primary sources were available on the topic, and these were mostly published in translation. Schors wants to make his readers feel the original taste of the SALT processes as much as possible by quoting extensively from his sources in their original language (inserted into German sentences). This paradoxically results in Soviet leaders and military men delivering their statements in English, a language most were unable to speak. Much attention is given to the formative period of 1963\u20131968, when the United States began to take an interest in a common effort by the two opposing world powers to reduce, and hopefully eliminate, the risk of nuclear war. U.S. officials thus began to work out the concept of arms control based on the idea that antagonism would be defused by agreed armament. President Lyndon Johnson made this a crucial element of U.S. policy but failed to persuade leaders in Moscow that this was the right direction to take. Only after Richard Nixon took the reins in Washington and chose Henry Kissinger to be his national security advisor did negotiations with the USSR start. At this point, pragmatic motives prevailed, including domestic considerations. The Soviet side was cautious as well. Head negotiator Vladimir Semenov was well aware that his mission entailed high personal risk: He might go too far either in accepting arms control or in seeking to avoid this outcome so carefully that he would fail as a negotiator. His opposite number, Gerard Smith, was also in an uncomfortable position, suspected by Nixon of seeking arms control at the expense of U.S. national security. As a way to control negotiations directly, the president authorized Kissinger to start back-channel talks with Soviet Ambassador Anatolii Dobrynin. Despite all handicaps, Smith and Semenov managed to build trust with each other and to reach agreement, if only on a limited scale.
