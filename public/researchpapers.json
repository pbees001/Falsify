Instead of allowing or expecting women to deal with these problems individually, we should address them by challenging the patriarchal structure of the labour market\u2014for example, by securing equal pay and affordable childcare. In a recent article in Journal of Medical Ethics (JME), I argue that we should distinguish between different versions of this kind of reasoning and that all the versions discussed are implausible. In three separate comments following my article in the March 2021 issue of JME, Moen, Segers and CampoEngelstein have supported and criticised some of my results. It is impossible, in such a short reply, to discuss all of their many relevant comments in detail, but in what follows I will reply to some of their criticism. Moen presents several interesting comments; let me try to deal with what I take to be the two most important ones. The first of these deals with some of my critical comments concerning what I have called the distraction view, according to which the use of NMEF is problematic because it draws attention away from social solutions. In my article, I mention that the ethical discussion of NMEF by politicians, scholars and the public usually also attracts attention to the moral problems that women face on the labour market. However, according to Moen, such an observation is off target, as opponents of NMEF do not deny that the discussion of NMEF attracts attention to women\u2019s problems on the labour market, but they oppose the practice of NMEF. Even if Moen is right about this, which seems plausible, it is not obvious that we can separate the discussion and practice of NMEF as Moen intends. The discussion of NMEF is necessary to challenge its practice; if no politicians, scholars or the public did discuss the ethics of NMEF, we could not know how and why some people oppose NMEF. Second, Moen argues that if NMEF is a positional good, according to which the advantage of using NMEF (e.g. in competing for jobs) is mainly an advantage relative to others and should therefore not be subsidised by the state, as this would not promote overall wellbeing. I believe, however, that there are good arguments in favour of the view that having access to NMEF is mainly a nonpositional good, as the result of using NMEF might be to have a child. Having a child by means of technology can be seen as a good in itself whether or not others have access to this technology and have children because of it. I take Segers\u2019s main comments to be the following two. First, Segers claims that the authors I discuss in my article are incorrectly reduced to adherents of the argument from individualisation, which concludes that it is morally wrong for women to use NMEF. Second, that I have overlooked the multifaceted nature of these scholars. I agree with Segers\u2019s first comment, although it is easy, from the quotations by the authors under discussion, to infer the abovementioned moral conclusion. However, it would have been fairer and more in accordance with the views of the authors being discussed if the argument from individualisation had been formulated with a conclusion that did not claim that it is morally wrong for individuals to use NMEF, but with a conclusion claiming that there is a moral reason for individuals not to use NMEF. To argue that there is a moral reason against a certain practice is not to argue that this practice, all things considered, is morally wrong\u2014it depends on the weighing of all the reasons for or against the practice in question. Concerning Segers\u2019s second comment, I am not convinced it is a fair criticism. In the introduction of the article, I explicitly make it clear that there are other reasons for being sceptical about the use of NMEF\u2014 reasons that, for example, have to do with a \u2018morally problematic peer pressure\u2019 to use NMEF, with NMEF giving \u2018false hope to women\u2019 or with women being \u2018victims of a greedy fertility industry\u2019. Some of these concerns are supported by references to some of the authors that are dealt with in the paper. Although very supportive and in line with most of the reasoning in my article, CampoEngelstein has two main concerns. First, CampoEngelstein claims that we may overlook some ethical problems if, as is done in my article, we talk about women as a heteronomous group. In order to know whether NMEF is beneficial to women, we should be aware of the social hierarchies that exist between women and include, for example, empirical data showing how less privileged women experience the access and use of NMEF. I agree with this, and if I had had more space in the original article, this is definitely an aspect that should have been developed. Second, CampoEngelstein believes that it would be more correct if instead of writing \u2018NMEF is able to increase the probability of some women having a child at all\u2019, I had written that \u2019NMEF could increase the chance of having a genetically related child\u2019. The problem with the first formulation is that it may seem to reveal a problematic assumption of what it means to be a parent that is best captured in the second formulation. I agree here with CampoEngelstein that it is a problematic assumption as parenthood can be just as desired and fulfilling if you are not genetically related to your child.", "authors": ["T.

These changes span social, emotional, and cognitive domains. While some researchers have argued that a domain-general development explains some of the changes, such a position is a minority view. In the current article, we provide some evidence for the development of an age 4 domain-general enabling constraint on children\u2019s ability to reflect. In turn, the development of reflection is argued to enable the transitions that we see within and across developmental domains. The model of reflection being offered is part of a broader action-based model of cognition and mind \u2013 interactivism (Bickhard, 1973, 1978, 2009a,b). The empirical part of the article presents a new object reasoning task. This task was derived from theoretical constraints on the interactivist models of knowing and reflection. Results indicated that most children responded to the task incorrectly until age 4 which was interpreted as evidence that they lacked the ability to explicitly reason about relations between objects. Correlations between our new task and standard false-belief tasks were explored.

What this journal has elected to publish is a biased, retrospective analysis of the published results from two successful, well-controlled clinical trials. In the author\u2019s own words: \u201cWhile metaanalysis offers a standardized method of data analysis, results may be interpreted in various ways.\u201d Following this declaration, Spielmans provides his limited personal perspective on the retrospective analysis, strongly suggesting that his uninformed personal interpretation of the meta-analyses supersedes the individual trial analyses conducted using patientlevel data by the trial sponsor and corroborated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of the drug approval process. In the limitations section of Spielmans\u2019s article, there is an acknowledgment that \u201cBremelanotide (BMT) appears to offer modest benefits on the Female Sexual Function Index-Desire Domain (FSFI-D) (Rosen et al., 2000) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Desire, Arousal, Orgasm, Item 13 (FSDS-DAO #13)\u201d (Derogatis et al., 2008). Spielmans is not a treating clinician and is unaware of the validation that was conducted, at the direction of the U.S. FDA, to establish clinically meaningful cutoffs of the various patient-reported outcomes to define clinical benefit (Revicki et al., 2018). It is questionable how Spielmans can both interpret and denigrate the extent of the comprehensive benefit bremelanotide (BMT) provides for a patient. In numerous cases, Spielmans states that placebo outperformed BMT; the authors of this commentary encourage all readers to avail themselves of the published results from Kingsberg et al. (2019), where Figure 3 presents the results of BMT over placebo for eight individual patient-reported outcomes within each of the two Phase III studies. Spielmans\u2019s statement is also factually incorrect in stating, \u201cmost reported efficacy outcomes were apparently derived post-hoc\u201d; the extensive statistical analysis plan that was prepared and reviewed by the FDA defined each analysis in detail prior to database lock. The phase III BMT program involving over 1200 women was the culmination of over a decade of research, supported by over a dozen individual studies involving the compound for treating this disorder (e.g., Clayton et al., 2016). The alternative interpretation of the retrospective analyses conducted by Spielmans goes far beyond claiming that the FDA was wrong for approving this drug. For example, he lists as a \u201cproblem\u201d that not everything in the study protocol was included in our Kingsberg et al. (2019) paper. In contrast to the Journal of Sex Research that provided 20 pages for Spielmans\u2019s article, many, high-impact, scientifically rigorous journals have a page limit. He also alludes to \u201cdata peeking\u201d in his introduction and that the FDA allowed the \u201csponsor\u2019s request for satisfying sexual events (SSEs) to move from the co-primary to the key secondary outcome . . .. a year after the trials had begun.\u201d What Spielmans omitted is that the FDA published a guidance document (2016) for designing clinical trials in which SSEs were no longer required to be a primary endpoint for HSDD treatment trials. Instead, trials could now include measures reflecting the hallmark criteria of the condition: loss of (i.e., deficiency or absence of) sexual desire (i.e., FSFI-D) and distress about lack of desire (i.e., FSDS-DAO #13). The approval from the FDA to change the primary endpoint, after discussion with the FDA review division, came prior to the data lock in these well-conducted, randomized, double-blind, multicenter placebo-controlled trials, with pre-established statistical analysis plans. All sites received investigational review board (IRB) approval and were conducted according to good clinical practice, and the suggestion of any research malfeasance by Spielmans is baseless and false. A researcher with expertise in sexual medicine would likely know the rigor and oversight of these trials along with the historical context in the change of endpoints that they reflect, the evolution of this field with an improved understanding of how to evaluate this condition (HSDD), and that SSEs had long been deemed by experts as a poor surrogate of desire and instead, a downstream effect of desire (Kingsberg & Althof, 2011). The medical community welcomes the constructive review by subject experts to help improve the process leading to the development of safe and effective medications for patients with few treatment options. However, the retrospective analysis performed by Spielmans fails to acknowledge the decade of diligent research that culminated in a drug that the FDA scrutinized through the development process to a point that", "authors": ["S.

INTRODUCTION Since the early 1990s, international peace-promotion efforts have increasingly involved international \u2018peacebuilding\u2019 interventions. These have encompassed diverse activities, 1 Acknowledgements: The research was supported by an Australian Research Council Discovery Project grant DP13102273.

In the 1990s, Western governments and international organizations operated largely within a \u2018liberal peace\u2019 paradigm, assuming that stabilising \u2018fragile\u2019 and post-conflict states required rapid democratization and marketization (Paris, 2004). However, from the 2000s, as failures of implementation and outcome abounded, peacebuilding has increasingly been delivered through \u2018statebuilding\u2019. Statebuilding denotes a \u2018broad range of programs and projects designed to build or strengthen the capacity of institutions, organisation and agencies \u2013 not all of which are necessarily part of the state apparatus \u2013 to effectively perform the functions associated with modern statehood\u2019 (Hameiri, 2010: 2). Peacebuilding is thus frequently combined with statebuilding to reshape target societies, polities and economies towards more peaceful outcomes. These efforts, despite their often technocratic presentation, are inherently political, seeking to (re)allocate power and resources and shift political outcomes. Accordingly, they are frequently contested, as are their associated modes of governance. In many prominent cases, this contestation has led peacebuilding or statebuilding interventions (PSBIs) to fail to attain their governance objectives, or even to pacify target societies, prompting critical reflection among scholars and practitioners. In the 2000s, some began arguing that these failures reflected incompatibility between the liberal institutions interveners were promoting and target societies\u2019 culture, norms and institutions, with resistance to defend local customs and authority undermining PSBIs (Richmond, 2005). This generated early recommendations for interveners to respect and incorporate local \u2018paradigms\u2019 into their projects (Chopra and Hohe, 2004). Policymakers have increasingly adopted this perspective, reflected in the turn to counterinsurgency strategies in Iraq and Afghanistan, which involve cultivating alliances with tribal leaders to combat Islamist insurgents. Practitioners now prescribe modes of intervention that are more compatible with local values and institutions (Mac Ginty and Richmond, 2015). This \u2018local turn\u2019 has spurred closer scholarly attention to how interactions between international interventions and target societies shape PSBI outcomes. The core concept used here is \u2018hybridity\u2019. This essentially denotes the mixing of international/liberal and local/non-liberal agendas, ideas, institutions and authority structures. Reflecting different usages in peace studies, IR and development, the concept is used diversely, with both proscriptive and descriptive applications (Millar, 2014: 1). For many peacebuilding scholars, \u2018hybridity\u2019 is a normative project, used to critique \u2018top-down\u2019 interventions and advocate engagement with \u2018local\u2019, \u2018everyday\u2019, non-state-based identities, traditions and practices to achieve more \u2018emancipatory\u2019 outcomes (e.g. Mac Ginty and Richmond, 2015). For many statebuilding scholars, hybridity is used more descriptively, to explain the emergence of \u2018hybridised\u2019 political orders through often conflictual encounters between international interveners and local populations (e.g. Wallis, 2012). This shift towards studying the crucial nexus between international intervention and local politics and governance was essential, since this is obviously where PSBI outcomes are determined. However, we argue that this scholarship, whether peace-based or state-based, has been constrained by the \u2018hybridity\u2019 concept. \u2018Hybridity\u2019 does not adequately describe international interventions\u2019 effects on local politics, nor does it properly explain their uneven outcomes. Despite recent efforts at nuance, hybridity ultimately dichotomizes and reifies local-traditional and international-liberal ideal-typical assemblages of institutions, actors and practices. Conflicts between these binary assemblages are seen to generate \u2018hybrid\u2019 orders. This approach is descriptively inaccurate insofar as some \u2018locals\u2019 support some \u2018international\u2019 PSBI agendas, while others resist. Nor do \u2018internationals\u2019 always promote \u2018liberal\u2019 agendas while \u2018locals\u2019 favour \u2018traditional\u2019 ones. Although recognized by some hybridity scholars, these complex realities are impossible to address coherently within an inherently dichotomizing framework. Moreover, merely locating PSBI outcomes on a \u2018local\u2019\u2018international\u2019 spectrum, as hybridity scholars do, does not explain why particular modes of governance emerge or whose interests they serve. Our alternative explanatory framework reconceptualizes the interaction between intervention and \u2018local\u2019 politics as a politics of scale. Scale, in political geography, refers to hierarchized social, political and economic territorial spaces, each denoting \u2018the arena and moment, both discursively and materially, where sociospatial power relations are contested and compromises are negotiated and regulated\u2019 (Swyngedouw, 1997: 140). Scale matters in PSBIs because interveners inevitably seek to reallocate power and resources among different scales, e.g. embedding international disciplines into a centralised national state (Hameiri, 2010), or decentralising power to subnational, state-based or \u2018traditional\u2019 agencies (Hirblinger and Simons, 2015). Scales like \u2018local\u2019, \u2018subnational\u2019, \u2018national\u2019 or \u2018global\u2019 are not neutral; they involve particular configurations of actors, resources and political opportunity structures that always favour some forces and agendas over others (Gough, 2004). Thus, PSBIs are not contested simply because \u2018locals\u2019 reject \u2018international\u2019 actors\u2019 \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019 agendas, but because social groups favour different scalar arrangements in line with 2 Similar criticisms apply to the literature on \u2018friction\u2019 in international-local relations. Given space constraints, we focus only on hybridity. their interests and agendas (Smith, 2003). What emerges is not simply to be described as a local-international \u2018hybrid\u2019, but must be explained as stemming from contestation over scaled modes of governance by socio-political forces located at diverse scales, potentially in tactical, multi-scalar alliances.

Medical hype in the media", "abstract": "The rise of online and social media platforms as tools for the dissemination and exchange of findings from health research presents both unique opportunities and critical challenges. A Viewpoint featured in the September issue of Movement Disorders highlights one of these challenges: the hype and sensationalism that surround medical treatments, and treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) specifically, in the media. This issue is timely, as media consumption has largely shifted to the online environment, and recent survey data show that 91% of physicians have seen patients who made inquiries about information they found on the Internet. Although online health information may spur important conversations between patients and physicians, low-quality communication about potential treatments for conditions such as PD may lead to important harms. The authors of the Viewpoint highlight issues such as false hopes, tensions in the patientphysician relationship, and potential increases in medical tourism, all of which are supported by empirical evidence. Overly hyped or factually incorrect online health information can also lead to the early adoption, use, and promotion of unproven interventions, as well as to negative health outcomes. As one example, a study about websites containing information about popular herbal supplements showed that one-quarter of these websites provide recommendations that, if followed, will lead directly to physical harms. On the societal level, overly simplified or hyped findings from medical research can dilute verifiable expertise to the point that the authority of experts over the subject matter appears questionable to those who are uncertain about whom to trust. This, in turn, can lead to a reduction in public confidence in both scientists and institutions, sometimes with disastrous consequences, as has been the case with childhood immunizations. Addressing the urgent challenges raised by low-quality online information requires a careful examination of the role of scientists, information providers, and patient communities in knowledge dissemination and exchange. To better understand the phenomenon of medical hype in the media, we must first consider the broader context in which it takes place. The deep specialization of scientific research, the evolving landscape of academic publishing, and the changing media environment, along with contextual pressures, have created complex new challenges for scientists and information providers alike. In modern academia, the \u201cpublish-or-perish\u201d environment combined with the explosion in the number of low-quality or even fraudulent academic journal publishers has led to a flooding of the literature with evidence gathered with varying levels of rigor. In parallel with this development, scientists face tremendous pressures to appeal to a wide range of stakeholders, including funding bodies, the industry, and the public. Taken together, these pressures can reduce complicated scientific discovery to simple sound bites or headlines, overly simplified reports, and exaggerated claims of real-world impact in a range of communication types, from media interviews to grant proposal summaries. Wide-ranging attempts to disseminate new research findings can result in miscommunication and misinterpretation, especially among nonexperts. Meanwhile, scientists who actively pursue high-quality opportunities for public engagement and science communication are viewed as less serious compared with their peers who favor traditional academic communication channels. On this topic, a survey by the Royal Society revealed that researchers felt that \u201cpublic engagement activities are seen by peers as bad for their career\u201d and that \u201cpublic engagement was done by those who were \u2018not good enough\u2019 for an academic career.\u201d The stigma attached to scientists to pursue media and public engagement activities persists to this day, despite the fact that the research community recognizes the benefits of an informed public that values medical research. Alongside the complex pressures scientists face when communicating their results, the media environment, too, is changing.

John ioannidis has made the case more scientifically in his provocatively titled article, \u201cWhy most Published Research findings are false.\u201d or, as marcia angell, former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, wrote, \u201cit is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published.\u201d in light of those rather depressing assessments, one might reasonably ask what useful role does a journal like Diseases of the Colon & Rectum play? the principal answer is that, despite its shortcomings, peer-reviewed publication remains the surest way forward in medical progress. i invite the reader to consider the alternative: unfettered and unrefereed publication that is free to report any results, however dubious, and to make extravagant claims, however unsupported by the data presented. Yes, this opportunity now exists in the burgeoning world of openaccess publication, and one can quite plausibly argue that the open-access model allows out-of-the-box thinkers to evade the conservative tendencies of the surgical academy, guardians of what thomas Kuhn famously referred to as \u201cnormal science.\u201d But let the reader beware, given the rise of predatory open-access journals whose overarching goal is to reap profits from author-derived publication fees, irrespective of scientific legitimacy. this is not to say that subscription-based publications like Diseases of the Colon & Rectum must not face up to their own challenges, many of which extend far beyond our own Journal and our own specialty to surgery itself\u2014in fact, to science itself. Peer reviewers are not seers, and peer review is not perfect; let us admit that. and the same can be said about medical editors and the editorial process. *** scientific and publication misconduct are fundamental threats whose actual incidence is unknown. modern software allows us to detect egregious cases of plagiarism, but outright scientific fraud in the form of falsification or fabrication of data is much harder to identify, especially when the primary data sets are not open to scrutiny. this problem should be addressed, at least in part, by an international Committee of medical Journal editors\u2019 proposal to require authors to share deidentified patient data within 6 months of publication. an even more prevalent concern is the incorrect analysis or misinterpretation of the data presented. these mistakes, when unintended, do not rise to the level of authorial misconduct per se. however, whether unintended or intentional, the net result is the same: inaccuracy and erroneous conclusions. \u201cspin\u201d occurs when authors distort their reporting to lead readers to favorable but often ungrounded conclusions. spin can be measured\u2014and its high prevalence is, at best, discouraging. the increasingly prominent role of industry in the design, funding, analysis, and authorship of major clinical trials presents a clear challenge to unbiased reporting. a recent Cochrane review confirmed previous observations that industry (versus nonindustry) sponsorship of drug and device trials significantly increased the likelihood of favorable efficacy results, favorable safety profiles, and favorable conclusions. and, unfortunately, Ten Years Before the Masthead", "authors": ["R.

Our scoping review addresses this gap by examining how the body of research on ASRH in SSA has evolved over the past decade, and its present profile, in terms of trends in volume, geographic and substantive focus, and Africa-led inquiry. Methods We used a three-step search strategy to identify English and French peer-reviewed publications and relevant grey literature on ASRH in SSA published between January 2010 and December 2019. Two reviewers screened the titles, abstracts and full texts of publications for eligibility and inclusion. Results A total of 1302 articles were published over the period, rising from 91 in 2010 to 183 in 2015. However, the bulk of the studies (63.9%) focused on six (South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia) of the 46 SSA countries. Ten countries had no ASRH papers, while five others each had only one publication. While issues like HIV (17.2%), sexual behaviours (17.4%) and access to sexual and reproductive health services (13.0%) received substantial attention, only a few studies focused on early adolescence (10\u201314 years), programme interventions, scaling up of interventions and policy evaluation. Just over half of publications had authors with African institutional affiliations as first authors (51.1%) or last author (53.0%). Sixteen per cent of papers did not include any authors from institutions in Africa. Conclusions Our review demonstrated that research on ASRH is limited in focus and is unevenly distributed across SSA countries. The identified gaps can guide future research and funding to advance ASRH policies and programmes.

First, \u201cbet on the people.\u201d If Lloyd wanted to make something happen, he searched for someone he could count on to accomplish the task. No matter how appealing an idea or a strategy, he tried to make sure that the right people were involved. Second, \u201cwriting is always a process of continuous improvement.\u201d No matter how many times he revised his own writing or someone else\u2019s, he could always find a better way of sharpening the focus or adding a more felicitous phrase. Third, \u201clook for the larger connections or the bigger picture.\u201d Lloyd invariably took a comparative perspective. That is what drove his efforts to make planning education and MIT more of a global enterprise. Few academic planners have left such a mark on their universities and the study of city and regional planning as Lloyd Rodwin. He was born in 1919 and graduated from City College of New York in 1939 after majoring in history and philosophy. It was there that he developed a love for intellectual debate and Socratic dialogue. After taking a course on housing from Charles Abrams at the New School, he worked in one of the defense housing agencies in Washington, D.C. Lloyd then studied institutional economics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. His reading and research in Madison nurtured his vision of city planning\u2014one rather different from what prevailed at the time. Planners of that era were generally trained in the architectural tradition that relied mostly on the tools of design\u2014maps, photos, and land-use plans. Lloyd was among a group of students trained in the social sciences who believed that planners should study the lives of the people in the cities and regions they serve and not learn just the place-making tools at the heart of professional practice at the time. His critique of the British New Towns policy (Rodwin 1956) provoked some stinging reactions from formidable figures in the field\u2014Catherine Bauer Wurster and Lewis Mumford (Newbrun and Oberlander 2000, 230\u201335). His critics, however, propelled his career by encouraging him to complete an MPA and PhD at Harvard\u2019s Littauer School of Public Administration. This eventually led to his appointment in 1957 as assistant professor of land economics in MIT\u2019s Department of City and Regional Planning. During his tenure as chair of the MIT department (1969\u2013 1973), Lloyd reshaped it\u2014even changing its name to the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) to reflect his strong sense that the field required an interdisciplinary research focus closely tied to action on the ground. Before taking on the challenge of revamping planning education at MIT, Lloyd had cofounded (with Martin Meyerson, the twelfth recipient of ACSP\u2019s Distinguished Educator award) the MIT-Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies, a research institute where scholars like Kevin Lynch, William Alonzo, James Q. Wilson, Edward Banfield, Oscar Handlin, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and its founders could work together with their doctoral students and generate even more \u201cintellectual capital,\u201d as he would say.

The GPM decouples the search space of the EC algorithm into a many-to-one mapping, allowing an abstraction of the search and solution spaces, which can bring a number of benefits to search. Grammatical Evolution (GE) is a grammar based form of Genetic Programming (GP) that incorporates a GPM at its core, which is loosely inspired by nature. This thesis investigates whether di\u21b5erent approaches to the GPM can have a positive e\u21b5ect on GE\u2019s performance. By examining a range of GPMs that use di\u21b5ering expansion order principles it was found the one approach, Position Independent Grammatical Evolution (\u21e1GE) presented a viable alternative to the canonical GE GPM. \u21e1GE, while showing good performance, uses a variable expansion order controlled by evolution. This variable ordering increases the size of the search space that must be navigated by \u21e1GE during evolution. It is found that \u21e1GE gains a significant increase in connectivity by using an evolvable order, while also providing \u21e1GE with additional neutrality. Knowing what orders \u21e1GE uses during evolution may provide insight into new GPM approaches. With this in mind a set of measures are devised, that allow for the monitoring of \u21e1GE\u2019s population during an evolutionary run. What is found is that \u21e1GE doesn\u2019t converge to a single order but rather a distribution of GPM orders. The addition of the evolvable order in \u21e1GE provides an added degree of freedom in the mapping that is not exploited by standard genetic operations. A mutation operation is presented that will allow the algorithm to focus mutation on certain aspects of the \u21e1GE chromosome. It is found that with this ability the performance of \u21e1GE is increased.

Michael saw something in me, and decided I was worth investing time and money in. I am forever indebted to you for all the support, encouragement, and supervision you have given me. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better supervisor, you knew when to push me and when to just let me figure things out by myself. Sean you were always there to bounce ideas o\u21b5, and get hands on as I tried to muddle my way through certain mathematical challenges. I must also thank Prof. Anthony Brabazon, while not my supervisor you always showed interest in my work, providing invaluable advice and encouragement. I want to thank all the members, past and present, of the Natural Computing Research and Applications group for the support, guidance, and welcoming environment they provided. Dr. James McDermott, Dr. Miguel Nicolau, Dr. Erik Hemberg, and Dr. Alexandros Agapitos, as post-docs you all provided me with a sounding board for my ideas and I am grateful for the feedback and friendship that has come of it. Special thanks must also be given to Dr. Jonathan Byrne and Dr. John Mark Swa\u21b5ord. We were in the trenches together doing our PhDs. You welcomed me into the group with open arms and I am very grateful for the friends you have become. I honestly don\u2019t think I would have enjoyed my time in research as much if it was not for Dr. Eoin Murphy. We have been through a lot together, BSc and PhD, and remained good friends throughout. I could not be happier knowing that we will graduate together. I do not like for my work life to interfere with my private life, mainly so I don\u2019t have to explain to friends what I do, but also so that I can escape and unwind when not in work. So I wish to thanks all my friends (you know who you are) for doing nothing. I know your help and support was always o\u21b5ered but I like to not burden you guys with having to fain interest in my research. The time we spent just sitting around having a laugh was exactly what I needed. My family plays an important part in my life. Kevin, Laura, Fiona, Rachel, Sarah, Keith, and Emma; thank you, I could not have done this without your love and support. I would not change a thing about the cloud of madness we exist in as a family. Most importantly I must thank my parents. Everything I do and achieve in life is to try an make you guys proud. The love and support you have shown me throughout my life has made me into the man I am today. Without your presence I am certain I would not be here today with this PhD thesis. Mam you pestered me about not wasting my intelligence after my first unsuccessful attempt at this college lark. My returning to education to do my undergraduate degree was a direct result of this. Without that I would never have achieved what has followed that decision. I can\u2019t express in words how much I love you Mam, and how grateful I am to have you as a mother. Tragically my father passed away the week after my viva. Dad I love you and miss you immensely. I know it brought you so much happiness the day I passed my viva. Dad, I am forever grateful for everything you did for me. You provided me with whatever you possibly could, and tried to nurture any interest I had. I am deeply saddened that you won\u2019t be around for my graduation, but I know you will be there with me in spirit. Finally, I would like to thank Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).

This queer Irish road film collapses opposition between mobility and home by uncoupling them from heteronormative structures of gender, desire, and space\u2014male/female, public/private. The film\u2019s protagonist, Patrick \u201cKitten\u201d Braden (Cillian Murphy), wanders in search of a loved one without whom she does not feel at home. Along the way, the film exposes and exploits the doubleness of both \u201cmobility\u201d and \u201chome\u201d in the traditional road narrative, queering the conventions of the road film to convey the desire and possibilities for an alternative domesticity. In its rerouting of the traditional road plot, Breakfast on Pluto does not follow a hero escaping the obligations of home and family to find autonomy on the road. Instead, the film charts Kitten\u2019s quest to realise a sense of home through trans-domesticity\u2014that is, to find shelter in non-heteronormative, mutual care while in both transient and public spaces.I affix \u201ctrans-\u201d to \u201cdomesticity\u201d to signal both the queerness and mobility that transform understandings of domestic spaces and practices in Breakfast on Pluto. To clarify, trans-domesticity is not queer assimilation to heteronormative domesticity, nor is it a relegation of queer culture to privatised and demobilised spaces. Rather, trans-domesticity challenges the assumption that all forms of domesticity are inherently normalising and demobilising. In other words, trans-domesticity uncovers tensions and violence swept under the rugs of hegemonic domesticity. Moreover, this alternative domesticity moves between and beyond the terms of gender and spatial oppositions that delimit the normative home.Specifically, \u201ctrans-domesticity\u201d names non-normative homemaking practices that arise out of the \u201cdesire to feel at home\u201d, a desire that Anne-Marie Fortier identifies in queer diasporic narratives (1890-90). Accordingly, \u201ctrans-domesticity\u201d also registers the affective processes that foster the connectedness and belonging of \u201chome\u201d away from private domestic spaces and places of origin, a \u201crethinking of the concept of home\u201d, which Ed Madden traces in lesbian and gay migrant narratives (175-77). Building on the assumption of queer diaspora theorists \u201cthat not only can one be at home in movement, but that movement can be one\u2019s very own home\u201d (Rapport and Dawson 27), trans-domesticity focuses critical attention on the everyday practices and emotional labour that create a home in transience.As Breakfast on Pluto tracks its transgender protagonist\u2019s movement between a small Irish border town, Northern Ireland, and London, the film invokes both a specifically Irish migration and the broader queer diaspora of which it is a part. While trans-domesticity is a recurring theme across a wide range of queer diasporic narratives, in Breakfast on Pluto it also simultaneously drives the plot and functions as a narrative frame. The film begins and ends with Kitten telling her story as she wanders through the streets of Soho and cares for a member of her made family, her friend Charlie\u2019s baby.Although I am concerned with the film adaptation, Patrick McCabe\u2019s \u201cPrelude\u201d to his novel, Breakfast on Pluto (1998), offers a useful point of departure: Patrick \u201cPussy\u201d Braden\u2019s dream, \u201cas he negotiates the minefields of this world\u201d, is \u201cending, once and for all, this ugly state of perpetual limbo\u201d and \u201cfinding a map which might lead to that place called home\u201d (McCabe x). In such a place, McCabe\u2019s hero might lay \u201chis head beneath a flower-bordered print that bears the words at last \u2018You\u2019re home\u2019\u201d(McCabe xi). By contrast, the film posits that \u201chome\u201d is never a \u201cplace\u201d apart from \u201cthe minefields of this world\u201d, and that while being in transit and in limbo might be a perpetual state, it is not necessarily an ugly one.Jordan\u2019s film thus addresses the same questions as does Susan Fraiman in her book\u00a0Extreme Domesticity: \u201cBut what about those for whom dislocation is not back story but main event? Those who, having pulled themselves apart, realize no timely arrival at a place of their own, so that being not-unpacked is an ongoing condition?\u201d (155). Through her trans-domestic shelter-making and caregiving practices, Kitten enacts \u201chome\u201d in motion and in public spaces, and thereby realises the elision in the flower-bordered print in McCabe\u2019s \u201cPrelude\u201d (xi), which does not assure \u201cYou are at home\u201d but, rather, \u201cYou are home\u201d.From Housed to Trans-Domestic SubjectivitySelf and home are equated in the dominant cultural narratives of Western modernity, but \u201chome\u201d in such formulations is assumed to be a self-owned, self-contained space. Psychoanalytic theorist Carl Jung describes this Ur-house as \u201ca concretization of the individuation process, [\u2026] a symbol of psychic wholeness\u201d (225). Philosopher Gaston Bachelard sees in the home \u201cthe topography of our intimate being\u201d, a structure that \u201cconcentrates being within limits that protect\u201d (xxxii). However, as historian Carolyn Steedman suggests, the mythic house that has become \u201cthe stuff of our \u2018cultural psychology,\u2019 the system of everyday metaphors by which we see ourselves\u201d, is far from universal; rather, it reflects \u201cthe topography of the houses\u201d of those who stand \u201cin a central relationship to the dominant culture\u201d (75, 17).For others, the lack of such housing correlates with political marginalisation, as the house functions as both a metaphor and material marker for culturally-recognised selfhood. As cultural geographer John Agnew argues, in capitalist societies the self-owned home is both a sign of autonomous individuality and a prerequisite for full political subjectivity (60). Philosopher Rosi Braidotti asserts that this figuration of subjectivity in \u201cthe phallo-Eurocentric master code\u201d treats as \u201cdisposable\u201d the \u201cbodies of women, youth, and others who are racialised or marked off by age, gender, sexuality, and income\u201d (6). These bodies are \u201creduced to marginality\u201d and subsequently \u201cexperience dispossession of their embodied and embedded selves, in a political economy of repeated and structurally enforced eviction\u201d (Braidotti 6).To shift the meaning of \u201chome\u201d and the intimately-linked \u201cself\u201d from a privately-owned, autonomous structure to trans-domesticity, to an ethos of care enacted even, and especially in, transient and public spaces, is not to romanticise homelessness or to deny the urgent necessity of material shelter. Breakfast on Pluto certainly does not allow viewers to do either. Rather, the figure of a trans-domestic self, like Braidotti\u2019s \u201cnomadic subject\u201d, has the potential to challenge and transform the terms of power relations. Those now on the margins might then be seen as equally-embodied selves and full political subjects with the right to shelter and care.Such a political project also entails recognising and revaluing\u2014without appropriating and demobilising\u2014existing trans-domesticity. As Fraiman argues, \u201cdomesticity\u201d must be \u201cmap[ped] from the margins\u201d in order to include the homemaking practices of gender rebels and the precariously housed, of castaways and outcasts (4-5). This alternative map would allow \u201coutsiders to normative domesticity\u201d to \u201cclaim domesticity while wrenching it away from such things as compulsory heterosexuality [\u2026] and the illusion of a safely barricaded life\u201d (Fraiman 4-5). Breakfast on Pluto shares in this re-mapping work by exposing the violence embedded in heteronormative domestic structures, and by charting the radical political potential of trans-domesticity.Unsettling HousesIn the traditional road narrative, \u201chome\u201d tends to be a static, confining structure from which the protagonist escapes, a space that then functions as \u201ca structuring absence\u201d on the road (Robertson 271). Bachelard describes this normative structure as a \u201cdream house\u201d that constitutes \u201ca body of images that give mankind proofs or illusions of stability\u201d (17); the house functions, Henri Lefebvre argues, as \u201cthe epitome of immobility\u201d (92). Whether the dream is to escape and/or to return, \u201cto write of houses\u201d, as Adam Hanna asserts, \u201cis to raise ideas of shelters that are fixed and secure\u201d (113).Breakfast on Pluto quickly gives lie to those expectations. Kitten is adopted by Ma Braden (Ruth McCabe), a single woman who raises Kitten and her adopted sister in domestic space that is connected to, and part of, a public house. That spatial contiguity undermines any illusion of privacy and security, as is evident in the scene in which a school-aged Kitten, who thought herself safely home alone and thus able to dress in her mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s clothes, is discovered in the act by her mother and sister from the pub\u2019s street entrance. Further, the film lays bare the built-in mechanisms of surveillance and violence that reinforce heteronormative, patriarchal structures. After discovering Kitten in women\u2019s clothes, Ma Braden violently scrubs her clean and whacks her with a brush until Kitten says, \u201cI\u2019m a boy, not a girl\u201d. The public/house space facilitates Ma Braden\u2019s close monitoring of Kitten thereafter.As a young writer in secondary school, Kitten satirises the violence within the hegemonic home by narrating the story of the rape of her biological mother, Eily Bergin (Eva Birthistle), by Kitten\u2019s father, Father Liam (Liam Neeson) in a scene of hyper-domesticity set in the rectory kitchen. As Patrick Mullen notes, \u201cthe rendition of the event follows the bubble-gum logic and tone of 1950s Hollywood culture\u201d (130). The relationship between the ideal domesticity thereby invoked and the rape then depicted exposes the sexual violence for what it is: not an external violation of the double sanctity of church and home space, but rather an internal and even intrinsic violence that reinforces and is shielded by the power structures from which normative domesticity is never separate.The only sense of home that seems to bind Kitten to her place of origin is based in her affective bonds to friends Charlie (Ruth Negga) and L", "authors": ["Kristina Deffenbacher"], "citations": 0, "venue": "M/C Journal", "year": 2019}, "7": {"title": "Chromosomal distribution and evolution of abundant retrotransposons in plants: gypsy elements in diploid and polyploid Brachiaria forage grasses", "abstract": "Like other eukaryotes, the nuclear genome of plants consists of DNA with a small proportion of low-copy DNA (genes and regulatory sequences) and very abundant DNA sequence motifs that are repeated thousands up to millions of times in the genomes including transposable elements (TEs) and satellite DNA. Retrotransposons, one class of TEs, are sequences that amplify via an RNA intermediate and reinsert into the genome, are often the major fraction of a genome. Here, we put research on retrotransposons into the larger context of plant repetitive DNA and genome behaviour, showing features of genome evolution in a grass genus, Brachiaria, in relation to other plant species. We show the contrasting amplification of different retroelement fractions across the genome with characteristics for various families and domains. The genus Brachiaria includes both diploid and polyploid species, with similar chromosome types and chromosome basic numbers x\u2009=\u20096, 7, 8 and 9. The polyploids reproduce asexually and are apomictic, but there are also sexual species. Cytogenetic studies and flow cytometry indicate a large variation in DNA content (C-value), chromosome sizes and genome organization. In order to evaluate the role of transposable elements in the genome and karyotype organization of species of Brachiaria, we searched for sequences similar to conserved regions of TEs in RNAseq reads library produced in Brachiaria decumbens. Of the 9649 TE-like contigs, 4454 corresponded to LTR-retrotransposons, and of these, 79.5\u00a0% were similar to members of the gypsy superfamily. Sequences of conserved protein domains of gypsy were used to design primers for producing the probes. The probes were used in FISH against chromosomes of accesses of B. decumbens, Brachiaria brizantha, Brachiaria ruziziensis and Brachiaria humidicola. Probes showed hybridization signals predominantly in proximal regions, especially those for retrotransposons of the clades CRM and Athila, while elements of Del and Tat exhibited dispersed signals, in addition to those proximal signals. These results show that the proximal region of Brachiaria chromosomes is a hotspot for retrotransposon insertion, particularly for the gypsy family. The combination of high-throughput sequencing and a chromosome-centric cytogenetic approach allows the abundance, organization and nature of transposable elements to be characterized in unprecedented detail. By their amplification and dispersal, retrotransposons can affect gene expression; they can lead to rapid diversification of chromosomes between species and, hence, are useful for studies of genome evolution and speciation in the Brachiaria genus. Centromeric regions can be identified and mapped, and retrotransposon markers can also assisting breeders in the developing and exploiting interspecific hybrids.", "authors": ["F. Santos", "R.

In contrast to existing music search engines that are either restricted to manually annotated meta-data or based on a query-by-example variant, the presented approach describes audio pieces via a traditional term vector model and allows therefore to retrieve relevant music pieces by issuing simple free-form text queries. Term vector descriptors for music pieces are derived by applying Web-based and audio-based similarity measures. Additionally, as the user selects music pieces that he/she likes, the subsequent results are adapted to accommodate to the user\u2019s preferences. Real-world performance of the system is indicated by a small user study. 1 MOTIVATION AND CONTEXT The recent achievements of the MIR community have led to many innovative and possibly unconventional approaches to support users in finding desired music. Frequently, content-based analysis of the audio files or collaborative recommendations to point users to music they might like (e.g. [2]) are applied. Some approaches also incorporate information from different sources to build interactive interfaces (e.g. [6]). However, to retrieve music from large databases, many approaches rely on query-by-example methods where the query must consist of a piece of information that has a representation similar to the records in the database, e.g. in query-by-humming/singing systems. Since users are accustomed to text-based search engines, which have become the \u201cnatural\u201d way to find and access all other types of content like images, videos, and text, query-by-example music search systems often lack broad acceptance. On the other hand, systems that offer textual queries, e.g. catalog search engines of commercial music re-sellers, permit only filtering based on attributes like artist, album, track name, year, or subjective labels like genre or style. To address some of these limitations, in [1], a system is presented that relies on a semantic ontology containing relations between meta-data and automatically extracted c \u00a9 2007 Austrian Computer Society (OCG). acoustic properties and that can be queried via natural language phrases. In the retrieval process, textual queries must then be mapped to the semantic concepts. With this system, semantic queries like \u201csomething fast from...\u201d or \u201csomething new from...\u201d can be processed. However, as with the traditional systems, the cultural context of the indexed music pieces is ignored. For real-world applicability of a music search engine, it must in fact behave like a Web search engine like Google or Yahoo! and allow arbitrary queries like rock with great riffs or even melodic metal with opera singer as front woman. Our first steps into this direction can be found in [3]. By using Web-based features to describe music pieces in a collection, each piece can be represented by a term vector. Furthermore, audio-based similarity is incorporated to describe also those pieces for which no information can be found on the Web. Thus, we combine information about the context with information about the content. For retrieval, queries are sent to Google and the resulting Web pages are used to construct a query vector which can be compared to the term vectors of the pieces in the collection. In [4], we have modified this approach to include relevance feedback and to use a local Web page index for query vector construction instead of Google. In this work, the applicability of the proposed methods is demonstrated. The user can simply initiate the search for desired music by typing some descriptive terms. From the returned items, those after the user\u2019s fancy are selected and transferred into a list of \u201charvested music pieces\u201d (analogous to e.g. a shopping cart in an on-line shop). Based on the chosen music pieces, the consecutively presented results are modified such that they tend to contain more pieces similar to the ones in the \u201charvest list\u201d. The user can continue searching by selecting (or ignoring) more results or by issuing the next query. 2 TECHNICAL FUNDAMENTALS In this section, we briefly review the technical basis of the presented application.

What was happening? She felt uncomfortable and all she could think about was that arm around her shoulders. What was Kevin saying? She had stopped paying attention to their conversation about scheduling a meeting. Within seconds, she ducked under his arm and made her escape. They weren't close friends. He didn't appear to be anything but friendly, but Alicia found it very intrusive. Frankly, she was shocked that he had even touched her. The incident distracted her all afternoon. Should she report him? Tell him to stop? What should she do? Background For 15 years, Alicia Jones had worked as a supervisor for Midwest Products. She was 50 years old and had extensive experience, first as a production assistant, and then moving into roles in supervision. She even could tell a story or two of sexual harassment experienced early in her career. But she hadn't faced this sort of behavior in years. Kevin Killian, 52, was recently hired as a supervisor from a competitor, and seemed to be fitting in well. He had about 25 years' experience from a couple of other companies. He was married with four sons, and had lived in the area for years. Alicia liked him and thought he'd be a good addition to the group. She had heard a member of his team, Lars Johnson, speak highly of him. A few weeks after he was hired, Alicia walked into Kevin's office to get his input on some meeting times. Alicia made small talk, \"Hi Kevin. How have you been doing?\" Kevin replied, \"I have been made to feel very welcome, thanks.\" Alicia raised the topic that brought her to his office. \"Say, Kevin, we need to set some times for management meetings. Do these times work for you?\" He looked over her notes and stated that they did. As they chatted, Kevin casually laid his arm across her shoulders. It made Alicia very uncomfortable. A couple of weeks later, it happened again. She thought, \"He must know that touching people at work isn't appropriate. Doesn't he? Has he never been in a sexual harassment training program?\" A day or two later, Alicia stopped by his office to drop some items off and Kevin was not there. She enjoyed a few minutes chatting with Kevin's assistant, Monica Tabesh, whom she had known a long time. Alicia asked Monica how things were going with her new boss. Monica responded, \"He's a thoughtful guy. Seems to know what he's doing.\" Alicia decided to take the opportunity to tell Monica about Kevin putting his arm around her shoulders and see what she thought. Monica instantly replied, \"He does that to me too. I hate that! ... I've taken to making sure there's a desk between us.\" Alicia went back to her office still thinking about the situation. She typed \"sexual harassment\" into her computer search bar and found the following on the Equal Employment Opportunity website: It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person's sex. Harassment can include \"sexual harassment\" or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature. \u2026", "authors": ["Claire L.

Most of them were identified as either prostitutes or underage runaways. Nearly two decades of police investigation finally came to an end with the identification of Gary Leon Ridgway as the prime suspect for these killings. On November 30th, 2001, Ridgway, who was nearly 52 years of age at the time of arrest, was apprehended for the killing of four female victims in the 1980s. Subsequent police interrogation led to his initial conviction of 48 counts of murder, with an additional count of murder added to the list later. Ridgway ultimately confessed to nearly twice that number, which made him one of the most prolific serial killers in American history. His common modus operandi was to lure his victims back to his house for a sexual transaction and subsequently to strangle them to death. His victims were then disposed of in wooded and remote areas, and in some cases, he returned to the dumpsites to perform sexual intercourse (i.e., necrophilic acts) on the corpses.

But some crimes have their way of being kept secret from the eyes of those hunting down the ones behind this atrocity, namely serial killers. This would not be possible unless the murder was planned out in such a way that was undetectable by the police and for that to happen it was necessary that the person committing the murders had higherorder thinking skills and a unique way of planning a murder so clean and perfect. Ted Bundy, being the handsome heartthrob of many young women despite them knowing his background of killing spree is the main subject of this research paper and through the unveiling of his psychopathic pattern of crime and his pattern of victim choosing, the murders of one of the greatest serial killers of all time are studied and exposed to have a better understanding of what methodology worked through the criminal mastermind\u2019s head. Keywords\u2014 Serial killer, Ted Bundy, young women, higher-order thinking skills, psychopathic. The infamous serial killer of America made his entry into the world of nightmare for young women in the 1960s terrorizing them and at the same time also being widely popular and most wanted by young women even after they had heard of his infamous and heinous crimes in and around the city. No amount of sense could be knocked into the heads of these young girls who despite having witnessed and heard of his horrendous methods of killing girls of their age and practicing sexual acts with their corpses, were ready to understand what kind of danger they were dragging themselves into and that the absurd fantasy they were trying to build around and for him was something that should never have been fantasized in the first place. Theodore Ted Bundy isn\u2019t the serial killer kind where one would expect the killer to look the part of a killer, dressed shabbily, ragged features with the description of a person who is able to commit such monstrosities painted on his face rather he was quite the gentleman, with ocean blue eyes, a charm that drew women to him in a snap of a finger accompanied by an aura which befuddled women into thinking that he only ever had good intentions. Killing women was nothing short of a psychotic fun activity for him where the thrill of abducting women in the hope of fulfilling his psychopathic sexual and homicidal fantasies was what kept him going and gave him that edge or the adrenaline rush in carrying out his crimes. His gruesome methods and the reason for his choice of victims were continually trying to be analyzed during his crime period by various investigators to find out his killing pattern and prevent it beforehand but then by the time they had gotten around to that, a large number of women had already fallen prey to his traps. The killer was captured at last but at what cost, the lives of so many young women who had to be test subjects and sacrificial lambs for the protection of those who were yet to be brutally murdered. What made his crimes go unnoticed is the larger question that is put forward through this paper and why were his crimes one of the most difficult cases to be solved is what is being analyzed. This paper looks at how higher intellect as well as a poor family background constructed a clear path for Ted Bundy to pull off his crimes with little or no difficulty. His sick psychotic brain functioned in a pattern like no other ordinary human brain because of which his International Journal of English Literature and Social Sciences, 5(6) Nov-Dec 2020 | Available online: https://ijels.com/ ISSN: 2456-7620 https://dx.doi.org/10.22161/ijels.56.57 2213 crime patterns were hard nuts to crack and allowed him to go about conducting new, psychotic sexual activities with the corpses or trophies that he refers to them as. Punished for his crimes he was, but what brought about these crimes in the first place is the first black dot in the life chart of Ted Bundy. The objective of this paper is to analyze the horrifying Bundy Murders in the light of his higher intellect in conjunction with a deficient childhood which constructed the platform for Ted Bundy to perpetrate his psychotic crimes in the most spotless way possible. The analysis of this will be in accordance with an autobiographical work that discusses a comprehensive history of the murders of Ted Bundy. This autobiographical text provides detailed descriptions of the complete history behind the mad killing spree, the methods, and weapons used for carrying out those heinous crimes, the pattern of murder and the choice of victims, and most importantly the life of young Ted Bundy: the very age where matters took a drastic turn for worse and happening to have a brilliantly high IQ just provided leverage and assisted the killer in making murders a neurotic and psychotic game of hiding but never to seek. For studying certain crime patterns of an individual, it is necessary to acquire information about the person and his background. For the purpose of my study, I will be looking into the information provided for Ted Bundy on the basis of an autobiography written on his account. The research methodology thus availed in this paper is qualitative in nature and is an autobiographical account of the serial killer, Ted Bundy. Articles written on other serial killers express similar ideas of crime patterns and childhood behaviors which have led to the corruption of young minds which in turn led to their murderous intentions. An article written by Hayriye Elif on Serial Killers: Nature vs Nurture talks about how serial killers are naturally made killers owing to some of their horrible family backgrounds. This background can be of childhood abuse that they experienced or any other such traumatic events in their younger years. In most articles written on similar topics, the same view was seen to be very accurate as even researchers have approved of this claim. She mentions that the intention to kill or do off with someone if comes naturally to some is mostly nurtured in others because of what they encountered in their childhood. This is where the article threw the spotlight on parents or other family members because they would all be collectively responsible for shaping or even creating an identity for their children. This would mean that a part of their future was mainly shaped by the occurrences and incidents in their childhood which thereby flagged their homicidal instincts at a later age. Other articles written on the crime patterns and choice of victims gave an insight into what would be considered as the basis for the choice of certain patterns or victims. An article by Mark Seltzer on Serial Killers (2): The Pathological Public Sphere talks about how a certain serial killer has his mark on young women who have opted for a modern form of occupation such as fashion or those who work in technological fields. According to researchers, these murders or choice of victims is largely due to wanting to not break from the conventional rules set by the society for women to be at home and do household chores or other jobs such as nursing which would bring out the femininity in them. Those who could not follow this was welcomed with the punishment of murder by these serial killers. Another article by Thomas Doherty namely Licensed to Kill: An Interview with Arthur Dong talks about his interviews with a homophobic serial killer named Arthur who took it on himself to make it a main preoccupation to murder people who are homosexuals as part of being a person of faith. This article acts as a supporting claim to this statement that serial killers adopt a certain pattern of killing depending on the twisted ideals that they either believe in or want to enforce on others. But rather than approaching them, they find it easier to wipe the person off the planet to avoid interaction and interference of human emotions. These articles therefore also gave an idea of how poor communication skills and alienation from society created the unnecessary space for these killers to advance towards their victims using physical force. The primary text namely The Bundy Murders: A Comprehensive History by Kevin M Sullivan talks about the whole history of the psychopathic serial killer Ted Bundy who was apparently going around killing young women in the \u201990s. The author talks about the numerous things that contributed to Ted\u2019s choice of a serial killer lifestyle and how it came about in the first place. The autobiographical account covers everything from his broken family background to his execution in an electric chair. Sullivan talks about how Bundy had been void of emotion in a few years\u2019 time after entering college. The emotional quotient was missing in him which is what caused him to go on a killing spree and conduct such heinous crimes. In the summer of 1974, Ted had already found the love of his life Liz but was unable to dedicate himself to her alone. The dark sinister intentions of wanting to abduct women and commit sexual activities with them were also getting stronger around this time. Around this time, Ted was into wild pornography where International Journal of English Literature and Social Sciences, 5(6) Nov-Dec 2020 | Available online: https://ijels.com/ ISSN: 2456-7620 https://dx.doi.org/10.22161/ijels.56.57 2214 female dominance over men was portrayed and where scenes of bondage kept him excited and thrilled. At a very young age, Ted was already referring to one of his class teachers as a \u201cvoluptuous disciplinarian\u201d and was seen committing sexual activities in the storeroom inside the classroom. Being a boy with brains accompanied by good looks had already scored him a lot of female attention in class which he later on claims is why he knew girls would or could easily be fooled as long as they found the person and his acts genuine from the outside.

Keppel and Birnes discuss the role of professional consultants and factors that influence the need for such individuals. In many cases, public pressure resulting from perceived lack of success on the part of police leads to the hiring of professional consultants. These individuals can range from mental health professionals and FBI profilers to individuals who claim ESP as their primary investigative tool. The Atlanta Child Murder Task Force Investigation (July 1, 1979 to May 1, 1981) was the first serial murder case to use professional consultants. The primary questions to be answered by consultants in this case involved strategies for profiling the serial killer and methods of catching him. In this case, Commissioner Lee Brown employed a team of seven highly experienced investigators to assist in the case. Review of this case and others suggests that experienced consulting detectives are by far the best in providing assistance. Throughout the book, the authors examine the concepts of denial and defeat and their effects on the investigative process. They suggest that, ifthese concepts are a predictable offspring of such investigations, steps can be taken to manage them. Particular attention is paid to advance planning and the need to have procedures and protocol in place prior to dealing with such cases. Further focus is placed on the need to have established lines of communications, trained computer professionals, and agency liaisons in place.

In these investigations, police used genetic information obtained from the open source genealogy site, GEDmatch, to build vast family trees spanning the entire country and several generations in order to locate suspects whose DNA matched that left at a crime scene. This Article analyzes the Fourth Amendment implications of government use of such powerful technology to explore such sensitive information as DNA. The conclusion the Supreme Court could reach, should it be called upon to examine the privacy issues involved in such intrusions, would vary depending on which avenue of Fourth Amendment analysis it chose to pursue. Maryland v. King, Court precedent on government collection of DNA, is so narrow that it provides little guidance on the issues presented by genetic genealogy. Instead, the Court could consult its recent ruling in Carpenter v. United States, which limited the third party doctrine that had previously nullified privacy expectations in shared information. If it relied on Carpenter, the Court would likely prohibit government downloads from genealogy sites without a warrant. Further, the Court could view individuals\u2019 uploads of genetic information onto open source genealogy sites as amounting to consent to view the DNA shared with all relatives. The Court might therefore apply its third party consent precedent, which, in relying on widely shared societal expectations, would likely prevent warrantless collection of genetic information from genealogy sites. The Court could, however, view police visits to genealogy sites as government searches that occurred after private intrusions. If the Court chose this approach, it could rule that law enforcement is free to collect the DNA [FINAL-FOR-TOM]DERY_GENETICGENEALOGY.DOCX (DO NOT DELETE) 4/8/2019 10:05 AM 104 HASTINGS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAW JOURNAL [Vol. 10:2 information because it is only viewing information already exposed by private parties. Finally, the Court could see law enforcement\u2019s use of genetic genealogy as an issue of standing, as recently analyzed in Byrd v. United States.

Two strategies are evaluated, the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller, built using the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), is compared to a wavecancellation scheme, obtained via the direct inversion of the frequency-domain transfer functions of the system. For the evaluated cases, it is shown that LQG leads to a wave-cancelling signal of the incoming Tollmien-Schlichting wavepacket. Such result allows further insight into the physics behind the active control of convectively unstable flows permitting, for instance, the optimization of the transverse position for actuation via a linear stability approach. 1 General Introduction The manipulation of the flow dynamics via passive or active control strategies poses a challenge with several foreseeable industrial and technological applications, and there is a particular interest in the delay of the laminar-turbulent transition of a boundary layer and consequent drag reduction, as the main expenses of a commercial airline are related to fuel consumptions [1]. In a low free-stream turbulence environment, transition of unswept wings is most often due to Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves which, depending on the Reynolds number of the flow, will grow exponentially until a critical amplitude will lead to non-linear interactions [2] and finally breakdown to turbulence. In general, the actuation is placed in a region where the amplitude of the TS waves is small, and the convective nature of the flow is accounted via a feedforward scheme, where the input signal is not affected by the actuation. Several examples of this type of control may be found in the literature; for instance Fabbiane et al. [4, 3] apply linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) and adaptive schemes and Li & Gaster [5] consider an inversion of transfer functions for the active control of 3D boundary-layers. The work of Fabbiane et al. [3] evaluates the energy budget related to active control and demonstrates that, even though the actuation is performed in a region of low amplitude of the TS waves, with the currently available flow control actuators, it can difficult to obtain drag reductions below the energy break-even point, for their evaluated cases. With this in mind, we propose an inversion technique based on the nature of the convectively unstable flow and show that the more complex LQG controller reduces to such strategy, in the frequencies of interest for control, leading to a wave-cancellation scheme. The control law is similar to the one proposed in Li & Gaster [5], however a penalization of the actuation signal is also included, which allows uncontrollable frequencies to be disregarded and increases the", "authors": ["K.

The ash spewed into the air during a volcanic eruption heavily restricts the surrounding air space that is usable for air traffic. The free air space must then be used efficiently to minimise the negative impacts on both the airlines and the passengers. DLR researchers in Braunschweig have used different simulations to identify the reasons for flight cancellations or delays due to volcanic ash and have developed action strategies for better handling problems encountered as a result of ash clouds.

The procedure is based on the idea of \u201cshaping\u201d the total energy of the closed-loop system with the nice feature that it achieves the tracking objective without the need of cancelling dynamics but by associating a natural reference (\u201csteady state\u201d) behaviour for all state variables. In this paper we use the procedure to solve the problem of torque regulation of a nonlinear induction motor model which includes both electrical and mechanical dynamics. We derive a nonlinear state observer plus state feedback control that insures exponential stability provided the desired torque does not exceed a given value. The latter condition can be removed if the motor full state is measurable. An adaptive version of the scheme that does not require exact knowledge of the rotor resistance or load torque is also shown to be asymptotically convergent. Three key features of the proposed scheme are: first, it attains the field orientation objective of the highly successful \u201cvector control\u201d strategies. Second, using the energy balance equation of the induction motor, identifies the nonlinear terms that represent \u201cworkless forces\u201d to avoid (intrinsically nonrobust) exact cancellation of model nonlinearities. Third, the control law calculation is extremely simple and globally defined, thus the strategy is applicable for all motor operation regimes including start-up.

Since most systems use point sensors like microphones to sense the noise field the quiet zone generated by system can be small. Outside the quite zones amplification of the noise may happen. In narrow band active noise control systems the dimension of the quite zone around each error sensor will be proportional to the wavelength of the noise being cancelled. In broadband active noise control systems several error sensors per anti-noise source are used (two as a rule of thumb) in order to achieve wider cancellations regions, but the fact still remains that the size of the quiet zone will be proportional to the wavelength of the noise. Actually using two microphones per anti-noise source makes the controller adapt in to a band limiting filter in order to prevent the generation of anti-noise with frequencies that are amplified inside the quite zone. In this paper, techniques to band limit the anti-noise are studied that do not need the extra number of error sensors. This extends previous work for the single channel case to the multi-channel case with several reference, error sensors and anti-noise sources. This can't be done by simpling placing a filter in the cancellation path, or using the anti-aliasing or reconstruction filters, unless you use a very sharp filter with long delay and a leakage factor. Instead several structures based on the MFx-LMS algorithm are presented that accomplish this task. The proposed structures also give some insight into the limitations of broadband active noise control systems due to the delay required to the band limiting action.", "authors": ["C.

The controller begins as a traditional feedback controller designed to cancel random disturbances. Additional filters operate in parallel with this feedback controller and attempt to detect predictable disturbances. When these predictable disturbances are identified, an additional feedback loop is invoked. This additional parallel feedback loop is designed to specifically cancel the identified disturbance.

In this paper we discuss the design of settling servo controller which provides fast settling performance without creating overshoot.

Whether selected by state popular vote or directly appointed by a state legislature, it is only those 538 Americans, who hold the unique constitutional office of Elector; it is only those Americans who have a real vote to select our 45th President in 2016. The real presidential election does not take place until December 14, 2016 when the appointed or selected Electors vote in their respective states. In this most peculiar of election seasons, will candidates and their non-coordinating Super PACs seek to directly engage with Electors to ask - and even negotiate with - these 538 individuals for their December vote? This Essay explains the operations of our Republic\u2019s arcane and enigmatic Electoral College. The Essay focuses on the Constitution\u2019s grant to state legislatures of absolute control over Elector appointment; on the 48 states\u2019 winner-take-all plurality tabulation method; and on the independent, free-agent constitutional status of all 538 Electors who will vote for President on December 14, 2016. Also referenced is the Constitution\u2019s even lesser-known fallback presidential selection system. In the event that no candidate receives a majority of the Electors\u2019 votes when the Electoral College are announced in January 2017, the newly-convened 115th U.S. House chooses the President, and the U.S. Senate selects the Vice President. The 2016 election year may be the beginning of the end for the antiquated, malapportioned Electoral College - described by Donald Trump November 2012 tweet as \u201ca disaster for a democracy \u2026 a total sham and a travesty.\u201d", "authors": ["V.

With no vaccine and limited medical capacity to treat the disease, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are the main strategy to contain the pandemic. Unprecedented global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders are causing the most severe disruption of the global economy since World War II. With international travel bans affecting over 90% of the world population and wide-spread restrictions on public gatherings and community mobility, tourism largely ceased in March 2020. Early evidence on impacts on air travel, cruises, and accommodations have been devastating. While highly uncertain, early projections from UNWTO for 2020 suggest international arrivals could decline by 20 to 30% relative to 2019. Tourism is especially susceptible to measures to counteract pandemics because of restricted mobility and social distancing. The paper compares the impacts of COVID-19 to previous epidemic/pandemics and other types of global crises and explores how the pandemic may change society, the economy, and tourism.

Recent studies have shown that in addition to dyspnea, hypoxemia, and acute respiratory distress, lymphopenia, and cytokine release syndrome are also important clinical features in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests that homeostasis of the immune system plays an important role in the development of COVID-19 pneumonia. To provide direct evidence on leukocyte homeostasis, we studied the immunological characteristics of peripheral blood leukocytes from 16 patients admitted to the Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases, Kunming, China. Among them, 10 were mild cases, 6 were severe cases; 7 were \u226550 years old, 11 were younger; and 6 had baseline diabetes, hypertension, or coronary atherosclerosis (Supplementary Table S1). Similar to the healthy group (n= 6), the absolute numbers of cells of major leukocyte subsets in peripheral blood remained at a normal level in both mild and severe patients. Different from that reported by Chen et al., we did not observe increased neutrophils or decreased lymphocytes. Instead, we found that the severe group had a significant reduction in granulocytes compared to the mild group (Fig. 1a). It has been reported that elevated inflammatory mediators play a crucial role in fatal pneumonia caused by pathogenic human coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). We therefore examined whether inflammatory mediators can impact progression in COVID-19 patients. However, no statistical differences in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) plasma concentrations were found among the three groups. Although patients had higher sCD14 levels than healthy people, there were no significant differences between the severe and mild groups (Fig. 1b). Virus-induced inflammatory factor storms can cause a systemic T cell response, reflected as changes in the differentiation and activity of T cells. Here, as significant differences in virus-induced inflammatory cytokines were not detected, we next examined whether homeostasis was perturbed in T cells at the cellular level (Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 1c, the proportions of multiple molecules related to T cell activation and regulation increased significantly in patients compared to healthy controls, but several functional molecules showed a marked decrease. Among the differentially expressed functional molecules, the levels of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and TNF-\u03b1 in CD4+ T cells were lower in the severe group than in the mild group, whereas the levels of granzyme B and perforin in CD8+ T cells were higher in the severe group than in the mild group. The activation molecules showed no differences in CD4+ T cells, whereas the levels of HLA-DR and TIGIT in CD8+ T cells were higher in the severe group than in the mild group (Fig. 1c). These data indicate that COVID-19, similar to some chronic infections, damages the function of CD4+ T cells and promotes excessive activation and possibly subsequent exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. Together, these perturbations of T cell subsets may eventually diminish host antiviral immunity. Usually a single molecule does not adequately predict disease progression. We therefore further performed cluster analysis on marker expression using data obtained from flow cytometry. Our results showed significant differences among the three subject groups in the level of exhaustion modules, including PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIGIT, and functional modules, including IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 (Supplementary Figs. S2, 3). Compared with the healthy control and mild group, the frequency of multi-functional CD4+ T cells (positive for at least two cytokines) decreased significantly in the severe group, whereas the proportion of non-functional (IFN-\u03b3 \u2212TNF-\u03b1\u2212IL-2\u2212) subsets increased significantly. Studies have shown that multi-functional T cells can better control human immunodeficiency virus in natural infection and are correlated with better outcomes during vaccination; thus, the functional damage of CD4+ T cells may have predisposed COVID-19 patients to severe disease. Li et al. showed that these multi-functional CD4+ T cells occur more frequently in patients with severe SARS infections than in moderate infections. This indicates that SARSCoV-2 may possess a unique immune pathology compared to other coronaviruses. In CD8+ T cells, the frequency of the nonexhausted (PD-1\u2212CTLA-4\u2212TIGIT\u2212) subset in the severe group was significantly lower than that in the other two groups (Fig. 1d). Because functional blockade of PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIGIT is beneficial for CD8+ T cells to maintain lasting antigen-specific immunity and antiviral effects, the excessive exhaustion of CD8+ T cells in severe patients may reduce their cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2.", "authors": ["Hong-Yi Zheng", "Mi Zhang", "Cui-Xian Yang", "N.

The authors predicted that the third governmental intervention\u2014a strict contact ban since 22 March\u2014switched incidence from growth to decay.

Science, this issue p. eabb9789 Modeling and Bayesian inference reveal the time dependence of SARS-CoV-2 interventions on the number of new infections. INTRODUCTION When faced with the outbreak of a novel epidemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), rapid response measures are required by individuals, as well as by society as a whole, to mitigate the spread of the virus. During this initial, time-critical period, neither the central epidemiological parameters nor the effectiveness of interventions such as cancellation of public events, school closings, or social distancing is known. RATIONALE As one of the key epidemiological parameters, we inferred the spreading rate \u03bb from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections using the example of Germany. We apply Bayesian inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to a class of compartmental models [susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)]. Our analysis characterizes the temporal change of the spreading rate and allows us to identify potential change points. Furthermore, it enables short-term forecast scenarios that assume various degrees of social distancing. A detailed description is provided in the accompanying paper, and the models, inference, and forecasts are available on GitHub (https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference_forecast). Although we apply the model to Germany, our approach can be readily adapted to other countries or regions. RESULTS In Germany, interventions to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were implemented in three steps over 3 weeks: (i) Around 9 March 2020, large public events such as soccer matches were canceled; (ii) around 16 March 2020, schools, childcare facilities, and many stores were closed; and (iii) on 23 March 2020, a far-reaching contact ban (Kontaktsperre) was imposed by government authorities; this included the prohibition of even small public gatherings as well as the closing of restaurants and all nonessential stores. From the observed case numbers of COVID-19, we can quantify the impact of these measures on the disease spread using change point analysis. Essentially, we find that at each change point the spreading rate \u03bb decreased by ~40%. At the first change point, assumed around 9 March 2020, \u03bb decreased from 0.43 to 0.25, with 95% credible intervals (CIs) of [0.35, 0.51] and [0.20, 0.30], respectively. At the second change point, assumed around 16 March 2020, \u03bb decreased to 0.15 (CI [0.12, 0.20]). Both changes in \u03bb slowed the spread of the virus but still implied exponential growth (see red and orange traces in the figure). To contain the disease spread, i.e., to turn exponential growth into a decline of new cases, the spreading rate has to be smaller than the recovery rate \u03bc = 0.13 (CI [0.09, 0.18]). This critical transition was reached with the third change point, which resulted in \u03bb = 0.09 (CI [0.06, 0.13]; see blue trace in the figure), assumed around 23 March 2020. From the peak position of daily new cases, one could conclude that the transition from growth to decline was already reached at the end of March. However, the observed transient decline can be explained by a short-term effect that originates from a sudden change in the spreading rate (see Fig. 2C in the main text). As long as interventions and the concurrent individual behavior frequently change the spreading rate, reliable short- and long-term forecasts are very difficult. As the figure shows, the three example scenarios (representing the effects up to the first, second, and third change point) quickly diverge from each other and, consequently, span a considerable range of future case numbers. Inference and subsequent forecasts are further complicated by the delay of ~2 weeks between an intervention and the first useful estimates of the new \u03bb (which are derived from the reported case numbers). Because of this delay, any uncertainty in the magnitude of social distancing in the previous 2 weeks can have a major impact on the case numbers in the subsequent 2 weeks. Beyond 2 weeks, the case numbers depend on our future behavior, for which we must make explicit assumptions. In sum, future interventions (such as lifting restrictions) should be implemented cautiously to respect the delayed visibility of their effects. CONCLUSION We developed a Bayesian framework for the spread of COVID-19 to infer central epidemiological parameters and the timing and magnitude of intervention effects. With such an approach, the effects of interventions can be assessed in a timely manner. Future interventions and lifting of restrictions can be modeled as additional change points, enabling short-term forecasts for case numbers. In general, our approach may help to infer the efficiency of measures taken in other countries and inform policy-makers about tightening, loosening, and selecting appropriate measures for containment of COVID-19. Bayesian inference of SIR model parameters from daily new cases of COVID-19 enables us to assess the impact of interventions. In Germany, three interventions (mild social distancing, strong social distancing, and contact ban) were enacted consecutively (circles). Colored lines depict the inferred models that include the impact of one, two, or three interventions (red, orange, or green, respectively, with individual data cutoff) or all available data until 21 April 2020 (blue). Forecasts (dashed lines) show how case numbers would have developed without the effects of the subsequent change points. Note the delay between intervention and first possible inference of parameters caused by the reporting delay and the necessary accumulation of evidence (gray arrows). Shaded areas indicate 50% and 95% Bayesian credible intervals. As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading across the globe, short-term modeling forecasts provide time-critical information for decisions on containment and mitigation strategies. A major challenge for short-term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change when first interventions show an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyzed the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections. Focusing on COVID-19 spread in Germany, we detected change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we could quantify the effect of interventions and incorporate the corresponding change points into forecasts of future scenarios and case numbers.

We conduct additional heterogeneity tests, and find that certain players, like Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, exhibit much larger away game absence effects, while others like Anthony Davis and Kristaps Porzingis experience much larger home game absence effects. Furthermore, the negative impact of a superstar absence is much smaller for games played in larger markets. Our findings have significant ramifications for the NBA and individual franchises, including NBA policies on resting players, the implications of suspensions for welfare of NBA fans, and franchise decision-making about dynamic pricing schemes in the primary marketplace. * Corresponding Author.

Understanding this concept is crucial not just for front office personnel, but the players and the coaches of the NBA. This research explored whether or not Moreyball accurately predicts success in the NBA. The methodology used multiple regressions between specific NBA statistics and the Win/Loss record of NBA teams. The results of this research showed that on its own, the main statistics of Moreyball were significant in predicting team success in the NBA. However when additional statistics were included, the strength of the model increases, demonstrating there is more than just the Moreyball variables that contribute to team success. MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 3 Moneyball to Moreyball: How Analytics Have Shaped the NBA Today The NBA is a league that has undergone many changing philosophies on both offense and defense. Over the decades there are many instances that show a change in how the game is played. Whether it is the installation of the three point line, or the introduction of the handcheck rule, the NBA has undergone many transformations since the league was formed in 1949 (Steca, Pala, Greco, Monzani, & D'Arrario, 2013). Defense in the NBA has shifted almost as much as offense in the NBA, and it is important to understand how these fads affect the league, and the success of the teams as well. The athletes in the NBA are stronger, quicker, and more athletic than their earlier counterparts (Mangine, Gonzalez, Jaijtner, Scanlon, Rogowski, & Stout, 2014). A transition from interior offenses to perimeter-based offensive game plans has caused a dramatic shift in the shot selection of players in the NBA, and as a result, new philosophical models have been created to benefit from this change. The concept of Moreyball has become the newest concept in the NBA, derived from this new-age, perimeter game, and the mastermind behind it is Daryl Morey, currently the Houston Rockets General Manager. His philosophy revolves around the idea that taking as many three point shots as possible, as well as many shots as possible close to the rim are the recipe for offensive success (Caporale & Collier, 2015). The defensive concept of Moreyball is centered on the idea of having a strong, interior defensive presence, and promoting the perimeter defenders to force their assignments to take mid-range jump-shots, statistically proven as the least efficient shot in basketball (Caporale & Collier, MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 4 2015). Doing so will reduce the chance of the opposing team taking three point shots or shots close to the rim. The core concepts of the literature, which are analytics, factors influencing individual success and factors influencing team success allow a foundation of knowledge to understand the many complexities of the NBA. The research method used will give the reader a concrete understanding of the data collected and analyzed, allowing observations that can be drawn and discussed. The intention of this research is to educate the reader and enhance their knowledge on the current state of analytics in the NBA, and the potential for growth of analytics as well. What this research looks to answer is: does Moreyball accurately predict the success of NBA teams? Literature Review The use of new, advanced analytics in the NBA has proven quite useful, however they are not the end-all when it comes measuring success. A myriad of factors influence success in the NBA, and they extend further than just emphasizing threes and dunks on offense, or tilting the defense towards whatever side the other team\u2019s best offensive players is standing (Bartholomew, & Collier, 2012). There are factors that influence the success of both the team and the individual. Understanding the factors that influence both individual and team success is important because doing so can assist teams in pinpointing where a problem may exist on the team. According to Aicinena (2013), a good coach has the ability to understand that there will be outside variables affecting his/her team. Also, a good coach will not lose themselves MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 5 emotionally because of those variables, however a good coach will not ignore the outside variables that exist (Leite, Coelho, & Sampaio, 2011). Understanding the multiple variables influencing individual and team success is critical, as well as their positive and negative interactions. Analytics The increased literature on analytics in the NBA has opened the door for more tools to be used in the evaluation of players and teams. Wallace, Caudill, & Mixon Jr. (2013) were able to provide evidence that disproves the notion that NBA players elevate their level of performance in the playoffs, specifically during the fourth quarter, which is referred to as \u201ccrunch time\u201d. Using the 2011 NBA playoffs as the source of data, Wallace et al. (2013) arrived to the conclusion that NBA players do not raise their performance levels in the fourth quarters of playoff games, but in fact their level of playing actually decreases in the fourth quarter compared to the first through third quarters of playoff games. Such a realization is compounded when you stop to consider some of the names that were measured in the 2011 playoffs: Tim Duncan, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Dirk Nowitzki to name a few. A common notion tied to these and several other superstars that participated in the 2011 playoffs is their ability to raise their performance levels in the fourth quarters of playoff games, however Wallace et al. (2013) were able to disprove this myth. Such a revelation will not change the opinion that diehard fans may have of these players, but when it comes to decision making by coaching staffs for and against these players, keeping this in mind can completely alter the game plan previously drawn up by the head coach. MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 6 This builds on the research conducted by Koehler and Conley (2003) regarding the debunking of the \u201chot hand\u201d myth. Using the annual Three Point Contest held in the NBA and coding that is designed to alert the observers when an announcer makes a reference to the state of the athlete, Koehler and Conley (2003) came to the conclusion that shooters made a high percentage of their shots before the announcement that \u201cX player is on fire!\u201d However, their shooting percentages drop dramatically after the proclamation of their present state (\u201chot\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d). Although this study is limited by the fact that it only observes the Three Point Contest, the contest itself was created for the NBA players that specialize in the three point shot to showcase themselves against others of the same mold, to compare who can stay hot the longest. Which is an interesting statement to say now that the whole idea has been disproven. An example of defensive metrics comes from Csapo and Raab (2014), in which they measure the effect of defensive pressure on players that are considered to be on a \u201chot/cold streak.\u201d Although the idea of the \u201chot/cold hand\u201d is considered to be a myth, Csapo and Raab simplify it to a player that connects on consecutive shots or misses on consecutive shots. Csapo and Raab (2014) conclude that as a player hits more shots, the shot difficulty increases as the defensive pressure increases, and that a player will then miss more shots because of the increased defensive pressure. Also, when Csapo and Raab (2014) take into consideration field goal percentage, the offensive player\u2019s performance is not increased during \u201chot streaks.\u201d Together, the research of Csapo and Raab (2014), Koehler and Conley (2003), and Wallace, Caudill, & MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 7 Mixon Jr. (2013), we see a shift in the reality of the NBA, from a league dominated by stars going on \u201chot streaks\u201d to a league that is educated as to why players seem to \u201craise their level of play.\u201d As a result, these pieces of literature can be used by coaches to preach to their teams to not lose focus when an opposing player strings together a few successful shots. A common occurrence in the NBA is when a superstar player is able to hit a few shots in a row, and on the following possession, the defender becomes too overzealous and overextends themselves, giving the offensive player an opportunity to bypass their primary defender and look for a high percentage shot, a theory reinforced by Koehler and Conley (2003). However, these examples of advanced analytics are leaving out an area that has become highly desirable for measurement: defensive metrics. In the NBA, Blocks and Steals were the only concrete pieces of statistical information that measures a player\u2019s defensive abilities. According to Franks, Miller, Bornn, & Goldsberry (2015, p.1), \u201cWhile steals, blocks, and rebounds do provide some useful proxies for defensive skills, they represent small discrete signals within the perpetual broadcast of defensive play.\u201d The work of Franks et al. (2015) resulted in five brand new defensive metrics: (1) Volume Score, which is the total magnitude of attempts a defender faces, (2) Disruption Score, defined as the degree to which an individual defender is able to reduce the effectiveness of his assignment\u2019s shots, (3) Defensive Shot Charts, similar to shot charts, but for a visual depiction of an individual\u2019s defensive prowess; both Volume Score and Disruption Score are mapped across the scoring area, (4) Shots Against, MONEYBALL TO MOREYBALL 8 described as a weighted average of the shots attempted against the defender per 100 possessions, and finally (5) Counterpoints, depicted as a weighted average of points scored against a particular defender per 100 possessions. When these new metrics are put to use by Franks et al. (2015), we can see a clear image of a specific defender. For example, Kwahi Leonard, a small forward for the San Antonio Spurs, is establishing a reputation as one of the top overall defenders i", "authors": ["Joseph Catalfano"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2015}, "6": {"title": "Modelling the NBA to Make Better Predictions ARCHpES", "abstract": "Unexpected events often occur in the world of sports.

According to Forbes, the Warriors have gone from NBA obscurity to the third most valuable team in the NBA. The objective of this research is to prove the importance of both physical prowess and business savvy in the sports world to become truly successful as a professional franchise. As the NBA has evolved, the Warriors serve as an ideal case study for hyper-commercialized professional sports. This can be seen through branding tied to their on-court performance, financial ownership strategies, and international market growth, especially in China. Successful branding strategies have allowed the Warriors to corner the retail market with their merchandise (Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant have the #1 and #3 most popular NBA jerseys) and the Warriors also lead the league in team merchandise sales. The Warriors\u2019 skillful financial stewardship has separated itself from other NBA ownership through the creation of the Bridge Club, the use of Silicon Valley precepts, and the cultivation of relationships with both majority and minority shareholders\u2014some tactics that are now being copied elsewhere.

The Visegrad Group has the experience of supporting its members in such integration.\nIn addition, Ukraine is concerned about the resolution of its defence problems. Takin into consideration the war conflict of Ukraine with the Russian Federation that started in 2014, issues of cooperation in the military field turned out to be of top priority in relations with the state members of the Visegrad Group.\nRecent research and publications analysis.

In spite of numerous studies of the above-mentioned authors, military cooperation between Ukraine and the state members of the Visegrad Group is understudied. Issues of working together with individual state members of the Visegrad Group in the military field need to be addressed deeper. Especially, it is important to outline military cooperation with the Republic of Poland in light of understanding the threats posed by the Russian Federation to Eastern-European countries.\nPaper main body. The Visegrad Group (Visegrad Four or V4) is a union of the four countries \u2013 Poland, Hungary, Czechia and Slovakia, founded 25 years ago on 15 February 1991, composed at that time of the three states: Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The union was formed as a result of the reaction of countries of the former Communist Bloc to the dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance that created economic and security problems for the states, which they tried to solve partially by the enforcement of regional cooperation.\nAccording to the instruments of incorporation, the V4 Group is headed by one of the state members based on annual rotation, with a Summit of Heads of Governments held at the end. The countries head the organization for one year by turn.\nThe main priorities of heading include expansion of the EU to the Western Balkans and eastern policy of the EU, cooperation in the field of defence, etc.\nUkraine is one of the key partners of the V4 Group, aiming primarily at establishing a comprehensive dialogue and elaborating a joint position on the whole range of topical issues of international partnership and political situation, including in the region of the East Central Europe.\nIn the period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020, the V4 Group was headed by the Czech Republic. Taking into consideration significant changes in the security environment, the program of Czech heading was targeted at the expansion of cooperation in the following areas:\n\u2013\u00a0internal unity (joint political approach and solutions: there were more than 10 statements approved by the V4 Group at the level of Heads of Governments and Ministers of Foreign Affairs since the escalation of the situation in Ukraine regarding the support of Ukraine and preservation of its territorial integrity);\n\u2013\u00a0defence and security cooperation (implementation of common projects both within the V4 Group and the European Union), and others.\nPolish heading provided for coordination of the position of the state members of the V4 Group concerning Ukraine and the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, and evaluation of the previous activities of the V4 Group towards the support of Ukraine. The Republic of Poland makes every effort to strengthen relations with Ukraine aimed at minimizing political threats and enforcing Polish defence.\nIn the area of military cooperation, Ukraine and the Republic of Poland achieved substantial success in formation of the regulatory and legal framework of cooperation and initiation of primary directions of collaboration \u2013 from participation in the Partnership for Peace Program, joint military trainings, sharing experiences, improvement of professional skills of officers, education of mobile and tank forces to formation of a Polish-Ukrainian unit.\nSupport of the idea of creation of a common security (defence) space from the Baltic States to the Back Sea must become a prioritized direction in cooperation between Ukraine and the Visegrad Group. Intensification of mutual efforts in the mentioned area will contribute to restraining the unhidden full-scale military aggression of Russia and serve as a factor of holding the Russian Federation from new re-division of the spheres of influence and territories.\nConclusions of the research and prospects for further studies. Therefore, Ukraine has a great potential for the expansion of cooperation with the countries of the V4 Group in the military field, in particular with Poland and Czech Republic. Planning of and participation in the activities within the regional military collaboration of the Visegrad Group with Ukraine gradually turn into an efficient ground for the achievement of the main strategic objective of our country \u2013 full integration into the European Atlantic security space and joining the political and military alliance NATO.\nFurther studies will provide an insight into the possibilities for enhancement of cooperation of Ukraine with the individual state members of the Visegrad Group (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia) in the military field and development of comprehensive measures to mitigate the destructive policy of Hungary towards Ukraine.", "authors": ["L.

The authors implement a research approach based on the fact that conflictology is a branch of knowledge at the intersection of different sciences and that it operates with methods and developments not only of philosophy, psychology, and sociology but also, above all, of law, especially in terms of methods of conflict prevention and resolution. Despite the fact that this science is now becoming more and more autonomous, we should not forget that it was formed at the junction of many disciplines, both applied, theoretical and theoretical and applied, and the study of its basic concepts, their essence, as well as preventive mechanisms, ways of levelling, and conflict resolution is impossible in full without recourse to legal mechanisms, methods, and means. The sphere of corporate law is the most striking example of the formation, use, and improvement of these legal instruments. This chapter reveals the essence of corporate conflict in the system of public relations, law, and legislation of the Russian Federation. \n \nTo achieve this goal, the authors define the concept of the corporation as the main tasks, as well as the nature and signs of corporate conflict. The approaches of corporate practice, doctrine, and judicial and legislative acts to the studied definition of \u201ccorporate conflicts\u201d and related or identical concepts of \u201ccorporate disputes,\u201d \u201cinternal conflict,\u201d and \u201cconflict of interest\u201d are investigated and compared. \n \nIt is noted that the needs of the economy, society, and law require clarification and development of a clear conceptual apparatus, and that its divergence is a common problem concerning the legal regulation of all areas of public life without exception. \n \nThe problems associated with the defects of the legal definition of the corporation and the lack of a unified view on it in the doctrine are analyzed, which, according to the authors, is one of the negative factors affecting the emergence of conflicts. The author investigates the poorly studied and ambiguously perceived by the doctrine characteristic of corporate relations, among which can be attributed to the corporate conflict. Another problem identified by the authors is the character of the conflict itself and the specifics of the corporate conflict. \n \nThe legal characteristic of the term \u201cconflict\u201d and \u201ccorporate conflict\u201d from the position of private law is given. The signs of conflict as a legal category in corporate law are identified and listed. \n \nIn conclusion, as a solution to the main problem, the need for a clear distinction between internal and external relations of the corporation and their relationship with the failed legal definition of corporate relations in the civil code is pointed out. \n \nRecommendations for the improvement of legal regulation are developed. In order to unify the concept of \u201cCorporation\u201d and bring the Russian legal definition in the civil code in line with international and foreign approaches, it is proposed to include in the characteristics of the corporation property criterion \u2013 the formation of the original property base. The necessity and ways of exclusion of non-profit organizations from the number of corporations are substantiated. \n \nThe features of corporate conflict as a kind of legal and social conflicts are listed. \n \nMaterials \nThe basis of the analysis carried out in this part of the work was the normative and advisory sources included in the system of Russian law in the sphere of corporate conflicts regulation. \n \nFor the purpose of a comprehensive study of the existing norms and the definition of promising trends in their development, the provisions of policy acts of a strategic nature, such as the concept of development of the legislation of the Russian Federation for the period 2008\u20132011 and the concept of 2016 to improve the legislation of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2021 were studied. \n \nThe study examined the provisions of industry-specific codified acts of both regulatory and advisory nature, such as the civil code of the Russian Federation, the code of corporate conduct (now invalid), and the code of corporate governance, approved by the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Russia from April 10, 2014. \n \nAmong the special Federal laws that form the basis of positive legal regulation of corporate conflicts are: Federal law No. 205-FL \u201cOn amendments to certain legislative acts of the Russian Federation\u201d; Federal law No. 82-FL of May 19, 1995, \u201con public associations\u201d; Federal law No. 193-FL of December 8, 1995, \u201con agricultural cooperation\u201d; Federal law No. 7-FL of January 12, 1996, \u201con non-profit associations\u201d; Federal law No. 79-FL of July 27, 2004, \u201con the state civil service of the Russian Federation\u201d; Federal law No. 7-FL \u201con non-profit associations\u201d of December 25, 2008, g. 273-FL \u201con combating corruption\u201d; the Federal law of March 2, 2007 No. 25-FL \u201con municipal service in the Russian Federation.\u201d \n \nIn the course of the study, the authors actively formed an empirical base and turned to judicial and arbitration practice, which were: the Decision of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation of July 18, 2003, No.14-P \u201cin the case of verification of the constitutionality of the provisions of Article 35 of the Federal law \u201con joint stock companies,\u201d Articles 61 and 99 of the civil code of the Russian Federation, Article 31 of the tax code of the Russian Federation, and Article 14 of the Arbitration procedural code of the Russian Federation; the Decision of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation of March 15, 2005.

This translates into many hours of manual work to export the kinematics. The proposed new tracking method tackles the above problems and reduces the time to export kinematics from several hours to less than 3 minutes. METHODS: Ten subjects (Males, age: 32\u00b14 years) with ACL reconstructed knee and healthy contra-lateral knee were selected from an ongoing study of ACL reconstruction (approved by our institutional IRB). After obtaining informed consent, 1.6mm tantalum markers were implanted in the distal femurs and proximal tibia of each joint (3 per bone) at the time of ACL reconstruction surgery. In-vivo 3D knee kinematics was acquired 3 years after ACL reconstruction during onelegged forward hopping (sub-maximal, hop distance 50% of lower limb length) using a new high-speed (both at 250 and 480 frames/s) and highresolution (with both 576x576 and 1152x1152 pixel) dynamic radiography instrumentation (DRSA) [1](Fig. 1). Performance of the Biplane Radiographic system was assessed using a customized calibration object (cube). Static precision (a function of system noise) was assessed with the test object positioned stationary in the center of the field of view. Dynamic errors were assessed by suspending the cube from a stiff elastic band and then dropping them (increased rotational motion), allowing them to twist and bounce throughout the field of view. A range of tests was performed using different combinations of acquisition rates, resolution, exposure i.e. 125-1000 images acquired at 250-400 frames/s with exposure (shutter) times ranging from 500-3000 \u03bcs. X-ray system protocols ranged from 40 to 90 kVp, 40 to 120 mA, 1 s with low (576x576) and high resolution (1152x1152) trials. In the trials with the patients 3D coordinates of implanted markers were determined for single-legged hoping trials using the DRSA method. RESULTS: The effect of resolution, brightness and exposure is shown in Fig. 2a,b for the high resolution experiment. It should be noted here that not only does kVp control the contrast of the X-ray, it also affects the density in two ways. As kVp is the energy of the stream of electrons, if increased it results in a higher part penetration. Increasing kVp also causes more radiation to be produced, which includes scattered radiation, which increases the density (\"blackness\") on the image. It seems that in most cases that there is an optimum in the exposure (kVp) and brightness (mA) combination. Increasing the exposure up to a certain point optimizes the gray level signature for the markers in the cubes moving at high speed in the calibration space. To distinguish between the two cameras we call them \u201cred\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d. The \u201cgreen\u201d camera is the camera with enhanced sensitivity and its lens can reach aperture of one (1). The lens on the \u201cred\u201d camera is set so that it cannot produce better aperture than 2 for comparison. It was obvious that increasing kVp and mA results in increase of gray level value for the low-resolution images. With the green camera there is almost a fourfold increase in the gray signature value when exposure increases from 40kVp to 90kVp. Only a two fold increase is observed for the same experiment in the \u201cred\u201d camera. We observed that at the high-resolution experiments, increasing the data acquisition rate reduces the displacement of the marker in the x, y-coordinates from frame to frame to less than 13 pixels (as compared to 30 in low resolution) making the tracking more efficient. However further improvements in the tracking algorithm in terms of the effectiveness by the \u201cLaplacian mask\u201d to enhance the contrast and identify occlusion areas is currently under way. The average marker area was apparently greater in the high-resolution tests in all human trials (Fig. 3). DISCUSSION: The DRSA method was tested with moving objects and in-vivo with embedded bone markers on patients moving at very high speeds. It was demonstrated that accuracy in tracking skeletal kinematics is much higher than conventional motion analysis techniques (one order of magnitude) and it can be performed at much lower exposure, almost at the level of fluoroscopy without data loss from blurring effects due to motion. Dynamic errors were greatly reduced with increasing image resolution. The interplay between brightness, contrast, exposure and resolution for the 1.6 mm tantalum bone markers was characterized for the new DRSA system with a variety of protocols.

The anatomy of the nail bed, capsular structures, and bony changes were described. Results.Marked nail bed thickening and contrast enhancement was noted in all clubbed fingers, with bone edema in 3 of the 4 patients. None of the healthy subjects had similar abnormalities. Conclusion. This confirms that hypervascularization of the nail bed observed in the microanatomy on high-resolution MRI is associated with clubbed appearances of the nails.

High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to study small joint arthritis involving the hands2,3,4. The importance of peripheral hypervascularization in finger clubbing is widely recognized5. Our small pilot study used high-resolution MRI to compare patients with finger clubbing against healthy subjects to gain better insights into the microanatomic basis for finger clubbing. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study subjects. Eight subjects participated in the study: 4 with finger clubbing (2 males, 2 females; mean age 43 yrs, range: 23\u201363 yrs) and 4 healthy volunteers (2 males, 2 females; mean age 38 yrs, range: 32\u201347 yrs). The study was approved by the local ethics committee and all subjects gave their informed consent. Patients with finger clubbing (clinically bulbous enlargement of the terminal phalanx, increased fluctuation of the nail bed, and loss of the angle between the nail and the basal tissues) were referred from the respiratory clinics (n = 2 with cystic fibrosis, n = 2 with fibrosing alveolitis; mean disease duration 9 yrs). The healthy volunteers were members of staff from the rheumatology department who responded to posters about the study, with no nail disease or illness. The groups were not matched by age or sex. High-resolution MRI. The finger that appeared most clubbed in each patient and the index finger of the dominant hand of the healthy volunteers were selected for imaging. One finger of each subject was imaged by high-resolution MRI using a 1.5T Gyroscan ACS-NT scanner (Philips Medical Systems). Subjects were placed in the prone position with the hand extended in front of the body. A 23-mm diameter microscopy MRI surface coil was placed on a distal interphalangeal joint including the nail, as described2. The protocol included T1-weighted sagittal and axial spin-echo, T2-weighted fat-suppressed spin-echo, coronal proton density-weighted 2-dimensional (2-D) spin-echo, 3-D gradient-echo sagittal images acquired using a water-selective radiofrequency excitation pulse, and axial and sagittal T1-weighted fat-suppressed spin-echo images after intravenous injection of 10 ml of the contrast agent gadolinium diethylene-triaminepenFinger clubbing is recognized as the oldest clinical sign in medicine1. The presence of finger clubbing is associated with a variety of diseases, including respiratory disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease, and malignant disease.

The imaging sequences were as published2. The measured slices were 1 mm thick, and therefore the acquired in-plane pixel dimension was between 160\u2013200 mm, with a displayed pixel dimension of 80\u2013100 mm. Analysis of MR images. MR images were analyzed using a commercially available image analysis software package Analyze (Mayo Clinic, BIR). The observers were blinded to the clinical status of the study subjects. The following structures were evaluated by consensus by a radiologist (EF) and a rheumatologist (JN): nail bed, nail root, collateral ligaments, extensor tendons, bone edema, erosions, and enthesophytes, as described3. The nail bed was defined as soft tissue between the nail plate and the distal phalanx, and nail root was defined as the base or origin of the nail underneath the skin. The results were recorded in a dichotomous manner (present/absent). The profile angle6, phalangeal depth ratio7, and thickness of nail bed were measured using the line profile tool in Analyze by a rheumatologist (JN) and a musculoskeletal research assistant (NAH) by consensus about the site of measurement (Figure 1A). Profile angle (ABC) was constructed by a line AB drawn from the distal digital skin crease to the cuticle and a line BC from the cuticle through a point C of contact with the nail bed. Phalangeal depth ratio (DPD/IPD ratio) was calculated by measuring the distal interphalangeal depth (IPD) at the distal digital skin crease and the distal phalangeal depth (DPD) at the proximal regions of the nail plate just before the cuticle disappears. The thickness of nail bed measured at the point where the nail meets the skin forms part of the DPD. Statistical analysis. Because ours was a descriptive pilot study with a small sample size, the results of significance tests are presented as a guideline only. Results are presented as medians and ranges, and pairwise analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney test. No correction for multiple testing was performed. No intraobserver or interobserver reliabilities were performed because the scoring was agreed by consensus between 2 readers for each component. RESULTS The fingers scanned in the clubbed cohort included 2 right index, 1 right middle, and 1 left index fingers. The patients with finger clubbing did not have any history of joint pain, and therefore, did not have hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. The healthy volunteers included 3 right index and 1 left index fingers. Measurements of finger clubbing. The measurements were obtained from the MR images. The profile angle, phalangeal depth ratio, and thickness of nail bed were greater in patients with finger clubbing than in healthy subjects. The median profile angle was 186\u00b0 (range: 179\u2013188\u00b0) in finger clubbing and 176\u00b0 (range: 154\u2013179\u00b0) in healthy subjects (p = 0.029). 524 The Journal of Rheumatology 2014; 41:3; doi:10.3899/jrheum.130823 Personal non-commercial use only.

For Australia, 2018 will be significant too, as the country takes its first ever seat at the United Nations Human Rights Council for a three-year term. Australia\u2019s ascent to the Council comes at a critical time; a time at which the work of human rights defenders globally has perhaps never been more important nor more imperilled. As civil society space closes at the national level, and defenders are criminalised, imprisoned and even killed \u2013 from China to Egypt, from Russia to Venezuela, and from Burundi to the Philippines \u2013 more and more defenders are seeking to use the international system to expose violations, to push for accountability, to obtain justice and protection, and as a lever for change. International civil society has high expectations of Australia as a Council member. We are a country with an overall strong record in building the UN human rights system and a rules-based international order, notwithstanding obvious gross departures when it comes to the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers and of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons and communities. Looking back at the end of Australia\u2019s term in 2021, these expectations will likely be met if Australia\u2019s time on the Council is characterised by three key elements. First, Australia should consult closely with civil society \u2013 both at the national and international levels \u2013 in developing its policies and positions at the Council. Independent civil society can provide vital information and advice about the human rights situation on the ground and how best to address human rights challenges and violations. With human rights defenders around the world facing what the UN Special Rapporteur has described as \u2018unprecedented attack\u2019, Australia should also prioritise protecting defenders and promoting a safe and enabling environment for their work at the national, regional and international levels. Second, in seeking election to the Council, Australia pledged to focus on upholding freedom of expression, strengthening governance and democratic institutions, advancing women\u2019s rights, and protecting indigenous rights, among other things. Australia should operationalise this pledge by leading and supporting country-specific initiatives at the Council where these values and groups are under attack. This means leading or supporting statements or resolutions where freedom of expression is criminalised, such as in Burundi or Bahrain, where democracy and the rule of law are systematically subverted, such as in China or Venezuela, where women human rights defenders are attacked and abused, such as in Egypt or Saudi Arabia, or where peoples are driven from their lands, such as in Myanmar or Honduras. Like-minded States have shown what is possible through principled leadership. At the Council\u2019s 35th session in June 2017, Iceland led a joint statement on extrajudicial killings in the Philippines, while at the Council\u2019s 36th session in September the Netherlands spearheaded a resolution to establish an international investigation into war crimes in Yemen. Australia, by contrast, has a mixed-record at best when it comes to addressing country situations \u2013 soft pedalling on accountability for gross human rights violations in countries such as Sri Lanka and Cambodia where Australia\u2019s refugee and asylum seeker policy had a craven distorting effect on foreign policy. Civil society organisations have diminishing patience for States that espouse a rhetorical commitment to thematic human rights issues \u2013 such as the protection of defenders, freedom of expression or peaceful assembly \u2013 but that fail to take up those issues in concrete situations where perceived political, economic or other interests may be at stake. Finally, Australia\u2019s term will be deemed a success if it uses the opportunity of Council membership to critically assess and improve its own human rights record, and takes seriously its obligations as a Council member to \u2018uphold the highest standards\u2019 and cooperate fully with the Council and other UN human rights mechanisms. It is in the national interest that Council membership is used as a catalyst and circuit breaker to address the profound socio-economic disadvantage and political disenfranchisement of indigenous peoples and to devise a refugee and asylum seeker policy that is decent, humane and complies with international law.", "authors": ["P.

DOI: 10.30535/mto.27.2.0 Volume 27, Number 2, June 2021 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Society for Music Theory [1.1] On June 10, 2011, soprano Dawn Upshaw performed a newly imagined version of George Crumb\u2019s Winds of Destiny: A Cycle of Civil War Songs, Folk Songs, and Spirituals (2004) at the Ojai Music Festival. Retaining the original scoring for soprano, piano, and percussion, Upshaw and director Peter Sellars transformed the Civil War cycle into a commentary on twenty-first-century war. She wore fatigues and the stage se ing included a bed in order to portray a veteran of the American war in Afghanistan. In the show, the soldier experiences an episode of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) while trying to fall asleep. During the second song, \u201cWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home Again,\u201d she springs to a ention at the sound of the military drums and acts out what one critic called a \u201cmini-drama\u201d of the song\u2019s narrative (Swed 2011). Her tone shifts from celebratory to funereal by the end of the song, adding what Crumb called \u201can ironic twist\u201d to its typical patriotic message (Wein 2011).(1) [1.2] Upshaw\u2019s contemporary staging illustrates how Crumb\u2019s se ing of \u201cWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home Again\u201d acutely addresses both historical and contemporary concerns about the carnage of war and its emotional and psychological consequences. The initial three verses of the piece feature traditional images and sounds of Civil War narratives: imitations of military parade sounds, snare drum topoi, and an earnest presentation of the original song\u2019s melody and lyrics. In this way, the piece seems to conform to conventional Civil War myth and memory that focus on heroic acts in a just war to end the nation\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d of slavery. In the last verse, however, the tone changes to one of sarcasm. Crumb quotes a funeral march from Mahler to invoke the musical grotesque and uses other semiotic techniques to signal that the ultimate meaning of the song is not an expression of heroic triumph but instead a public display of mourning and regret (Edwards 2017; Evere 2009; Meindl 1996; Sheinberg 2000).(2) [1.3] Crumb\u2019s ironic se ing of \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d changes its original meaning and suggests that traditional collective memory of the Civil War no longer holds. Through his se ing, Crumb both memorializes and criticizes the Civil War. In his critical se ing, the Civil War serves as a metonym for the legacy of American wars in a broad sense. As a material remembrance of the Civil War that \u201cclaims a particular historical narrative\u201d (Doss 2010, 9), I argue that Winds of Destiny and specifically \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d function as artifacts of Civil War memory and broader American collective memory of wars in general. I situate this individual song in the context of American memorialization and monument culture, including Civil War monuments and material tributes to more recent conflicts. Following Erika Doss, I show how this piece can be understood as a material manifestation of public memory while also contesting certain elements of American war remembrance. Though musical memorials differ from statues, Crumb\u2019s piece nevertheless manifests images of collective public memory of the Civil War through its sonic material and conveys the same types of narrative content Doss identifies in monuments around the country. [1.4] In discussing the piece\u2019s initial celebratory verses, I adapt J. Martin Daughtry\u2019s concept of belliphonic sounds, or sounds that encompass the sonic experience and violence of war (Daughtry 2015, 161). For Daughtry, the belliphonic encompasses all sounds of war, including propagandistic messages that frequently accompany it and occur when celebrating it. While many of Daughtry\u2019s examples of the belliphonic focus on weapons, electricity generators, or vehicle sounds, he recognizes musical expressions as well, such as the Muslim adhan that features prominently in Iraq\u2019s belliphonic soundscape. In this case, I expand the belliphonic to apply to post-war celebration, in particular how it may be used to justify previous and future acts of war. Aesthetic responses to war form an indirect but integral part of the belliphonic. Various se ings of \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d serve utilitarian, patriotic, and legitimizing purposes. In the Civil War, men could sing the song to provide a consistent marching tempo as army units moved. In victory celebrations, the song is sung or played to convey a sense of military power and accompanying notions of justice used to rationalize wartime actions. Crumb\u2019s first three verses employ the song to evoke such commemorations, tacitly invoking the belliphonic music of the Civil War. Commemorative music like Crumb\u2019s act as \u201cdiscursive structures\u201d that Daughtry cites as enabling violent acts of war (Daughtry 2015, 11). In Crumb\u2019s se ing, the initial verses display a more conventionally optimistic response to war, celebrating soldiers and their sacrifices. However, Crumb\u2019s fourth verse distorts any a empt to stir up patriotic sentiment by replacing notions of martial justice with expressions of mourning. Daughtry poses the question: \u201cWhat kinds of victims, what kinds of survivors, do belliphonic sounds create?\u201d (Daughtry 2015, 5). The fourth verse provides an answer. In this case, it creates mourners whose grief distorts patriotic expressions of the belliphonic. Crumb\u2019s \u201cWhen Johnny,\u201d brought to life in part by its celebratory drums and whistling, is a sonic remembrance of all those who died in the Civil War. [1.5] In the following sections, I analyze the semiotics of Crumb\u2019s victorious military parade sounds in the initial verses. Crumb portrays the glory of war, as demonstrated in such a parade, through unpredictable, loud, fast, and unevenly timed sounds. Marching cadences and snare drums suggest military drill formations or parade marching; weapon sounds suggest the ceremonial firing of guns and cannons, though the ba le has ceased. The piece\u2019s timbres, pitch organization, and rhythms create an affect that displays military might and glorifies the army\u2019s power in ways that support traditional notions of heroism, militarism, and masculinity (Doss 2010, 24). These verses connect images of martial strength with the triumphant lyrics that reference a peaceful, merry time when Johnny and the other soldiers return from war. Ultimately, I next show how the grotesque affect of the final verse, which depicts a funeral procession for \u201cJohnny,\u201d mocks both the Civil War era\u2019s cultural values as well as expressions of more recent American patriotism. Third, I discuss how Crumb\u2019s quotation of Mahler prompts reflection on who is commemorated through this march, and who accompanies \u201cJohnny\u201d to the grave. [1.6] In a manner analogous to visual memorials, this song relies on musical affect, or expressed emotions or feelings, to convey a point of view on American war culture (Doss 2010, 15). I use \u201caffect\u201d because memorials and monuments aim to produce certain emotional responses in their visitors, and musical memorials function likewise.(3) Musical affect may be conveyed by cues such as quotations, schemata, and tropes. Hearing the work allude to a celebratory military march that conveys parade sounds and displays power can elicit a specific range of emotional response from listeners, as can hearing its contrasting affect in the fourth verse. That abrupt shift implies that the heroism, masculinity, and militarism of the initial sections are artifices fabricated to justify the death and destruction of war. Memorials effectively reconstruct the past in light of contemporary social need. As such, Crumb\u2019s piece responds to his need to re-examine American militarism (Doss 2010, 46). Just as monuments strongly convey aspects of how Americans view themselves today, in Crumb\u2019s commentary, the Civil War stands in for the idea of violent military conflict in general (Doss 2010, 15). This theme is consistent with social criticisms of recent American wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, helping to illuminate why Upshaw was compelled to perform Crumb\u2019s piece in this manner. [1.7] It is important to remember that \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d functioned as a musical memorial long before Crumb\u2019s se ing. The song was wri en in 1863 by Patrick S. Gilmore (1829\u20131892), a wellknown Irish bandleader in the Union army, and has been steadily popular since then.(4) The tune of \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d appears prominently in Morton Gould\u2019s American Salute (1942), which is often performed by military bands such as The President\u2019s Own and by high school bands across the country. It is also regularly performed by the Navy Band and the Air Force Band at ceremonies, memorials, and commemorations. \u201cWhen Johnny\u201d also appears with other patriotic tunes in the Civil War Fantasy (1961) by Jerry Bilik, a frequently played symphonic band piece. Doss (2010, 25) writes that physical memorials, especially statues, have served to champion \u201ccollective national ideas, as did a widespread public culture of national anthems, holidays, festivals, and fairs.\u201d Arrangements of \u201cWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home Again\u201d are well suited musical accompaniments to such events because the song traditionally expresses enthusiasm for patriotic narratives of men\u2019s heroic deeds and successful return from war. [1.8] At the same time, the song itself has served as a vehicle for critique (Library of Congres", "authors": ["Abigail Shupe"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2021}, "2": {"title": "Tell Me No Lies: Investigative Journalism and its Triumphs", "abstract": "Over the past few decades, 'investigative journalism' has come to mean the kind of brave reporting that exposes injustice, wrongdoing and, above all, the abuse of power.

In selecting for this anthology articles, broadcasts and book extracts that have got behind the facade of official silence to reveal important and disturbing truths, John Pilger is paying his own professional tribute to some of the men and women he most admires. Here are the famous muckrakers (Seymour Hersh on the My Lai massacre), as well as the less well known (Wilfred Burchett, the first Westerner to enter Hiroshima in September 1945; Israeli journalist Amira Hass, reporting from the Gaza Strip in the 1990s). Here, too, are the mavericks (the great German undercover reporter Gunter Wallraff; Jessica Mitford on 'The American Way of Death'). The book ranges from across many of the critical events, scandals and struggles of the past fifty years, from the scenes witnessed at the liberation of the death camp at Dachau in 1945, to the bloodshed caused by the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Along the way it bears witness to epic injustices committed against the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, East Timor and Palestine. John Pilger sets each piece of reporting in its context, often offering personal insights into the writer, and introduces the collection with a passionate essay arguing that the kind of journalism he celebrates here is being subverted by the very forces that ought to be its enemy.

[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Birthday celebrations Carl Linnaeus just turned a venerable 300! Most students know only about his penchant for creating Latin names for some 7,700 plants and 4,400 animals. However, his contribution to science goes beyond that. Stephen Jay Gould's famous essay, Linnaeus's Luck? (2000), suggested that Linnaeus had a far greater understanding of evolution than he admitted to his peers, almost 100 years before Lamarck and Darwin offered their models. Linnaeus (Blunt and Stearn 2002) is a fascinating and rounded portrait of Linnaeus, charting his rise from a poor student at Lund University to Professor of Medicine at Uppsala and a founder of the Royal Academy of Sciences. Linnaeus is a beautiful book from a talented biological illustrater, which provides many details of both life and biology. The year 2009 will mark Charles Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species (1859). You could prepare by watching the finches in your backyard, or further, grab a good book about Darwin. Reviewer Debbie Chessin suggests that everyone should reread The Voyage of the Beagle (Darwin 1909). In a proposed trilogy on Darwin's life, Charles Darwin: The Power of Place (2002), author Janet Browne begins in 1858, providing details of Darwin's far-ranging interests and the politics surrounding the publication of his works. Reviewer Cary Seidman says: \"Reviewing the lively, intellectual discussion of Darwin's revolutionary ideas, which occurred over 100 years ago will encourage responsible and caring science teachers to continue framing their teaching around one of history's most powerful and far-reaching ideas.\" Eloise Farmer recommends author Jonathan Weiner, who has not only written The Beak of the Finch (1995), but also Time, Love, Memory: A Great Biologist and His Quest for the Origins of Behavior (1999) about Seymour Benzer, an unsung pioneer of molecular biology. For a content update, reviewer Charles Jervis recommends The Plausibility of Life: Resolving Darwin's Dilemma by Marc W. Kirschner and John C. Gerhart (2005) for those who want more details and an integration of modern biological techniques. Jervis says: \"Bringing together ideas as diverse as the origins of deer antlers, shifts in hemoglobin oxygen affinity, neural crest fate in embryological development, the Cambrian Explosion, and operon gene regulation, the authors paint a convincing picture.\" If you want to spend your vacation preparing to help students celebrate evolutionary science, reviewer David Brock suggests you grab Evolution 101 by Randy Moore and Janice Moore (2006). \"Seldom is a book so well written and well researched that it ought to be required reading for every thinking person,\" Brock says.

By Sandra Moats. (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2010. Pp. 255. Cloth, $36.00.)Reviewed by Ronald J. Zboray and Mary Saracino ZborayDuring the past two decades, scholarship on the vital roles that public celebrations, memorials, and rituals have played during the early American republic has broadened our understanding of the inextricable intersections between government, the body politic, and cultural life. Studies by Simon P. Newman, Sarah J. Purcell, Len Travers, and David Waldstreicher have explored the ways politicos and common people alike constructed political cultures, civic memory, and, indeed, nationalism itself, out of, for example, George Washington's birthday fetes, Bunker Hill commemorations, and Independence Day processions. These historians have also located meaning-making contests among varied groups within public festivity, from partisan politicos jockeying for power to disfranchised women and free African Americans struggling to achieve a sense of agency. In this study, an expansion of her 2001 dissertation about President Monroe's 1817-1819 national tours, Sandra Moats brings to this ongoing conversation a focus on the positions that the first five presidents - particularly George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Monroe - assumed within this world of political spectacle.1Celebrating the Republic \"tells the story,\" according to Moats, \"of how our first presidents invented the American political culture that endures today by employing the symbols and rituals they believed best illustrated republican principles to an American citizenry who now possessed sovereign authority over this new national government\" (3). The fivechapter-long story reconstructed from published presidents' papers, congressional documents, and newspapers, is based upon the premise that popular sovereignty was not a \" 'fiction,' \" and that this \"governing principle had to be activated for the new government to succeed\" (6). The first two chapters are devoted to Washington, who, beginning with his pre-inaugural procession that approximated a \"royal progress\" through triumphal arches, appropriated monarchial traditions for republican ends - to reach the sovereign citizenry. His 1789-1791 national tours, graced by receptions, toasting, and speechifying, as well as his open houses, levees, and dinner parties at the capital, provided accessibility, but smacked of aristocratic pretension according to critics. Republicans pounced - none more relentlessly and covertly than Thomas Jefferson, according to Moats - on regal presidential ceremony, even as John Adams was strategically lowering its register during his administration. Assaults upon Federalist-fashioned pomp hardened under Jefferson - the subject of chapter 3 - who \"adopted an intentionally unadorned public style\" (83) that at times made his official hostess, Dolley Madison, flinch. Jefferson's dismantling of formality, however, \"introduced a new generation of voters to a new way of honoring republicanism\" (88). While James and Dolley Madison brought back some of the bygone elegance, it was James Monroe who revived Washington's ceremonial tours - albeit without some of their fussiness and on a larger, more regionally denned stage that lent distinct local flavor to the proceedings. Chapters 4 and 5 show that although Monroe's nonpartisan tours were meant to celebrate national unity, they invited last-gasp Federalist rallying in the Northeast, unleashed election-minded Republican horntooting in the South and West, and engendered newspaper attacks all around. Moats concludes that the architects of the Second Party System refashioned political ceremony in more democratic ways, but with the same end in mind as their predecessors, namely \"putting sovereign citizens in contact with their government\" (171). \u2026", "authors": ["Ronald J.

The previous day, we had held a celebration of his recent 95th birthday at EPRI, with Chauncey holding forth on his life experiences and lessons learned. He was in fine fettle. The following morning, before leaving for his office at EPRI, as he had been doing ever since his official retirement 30 years previously, he took his usual short nap after breakfast. But this time, he didn\u2019t wake up. It is hard to conceive of a more graceful way to end a long and fulfilling career. Starr was born in Newark, New Jersey, the second son of Jewish\u2013Russian immigrants. Educated in the local public-school system, he went on to earn degrees in engineering and physics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York. His 1935 PhD thesis examined the thermal and electrical properties of rectifying copper-oxide junctions. I used to kid him that if he had accidentally introduced some calcium impurities into his samples, he might have discovered today\u2019s family of hightemperature cuprate superconductors. He then joined Percy Bridgman\u2019s group at Harvard University to work on the thermal transport properties of metals at high pressure. This is one of the most difficult of condensed-matter experiments to carry out, given the confounding background of containment vessel and thermometry. Starr, however, devised a differential method that could much more accurately determine the thermal diffusivity (thermal conductivity and specific heat) of metals in such a situation. This was an especially notable advance at the time: Bridgman had published work suggesting that the Wiedemann\u2013Franz law, which links the thermal and electrical conductivities of metals, and was one of the lynchpins of the then emerging quantum theory of solids, may not apply to metals under pressure. With his new technique, Starr was able to show that this conclusion resulted from systematic errors in Bridgman\u2019s previous experiments. To claim that he saved Bridgman from not receiving his future Nobel prize may be a stretch, but he certainly rescued his boss from major embarrassment. Twenty-five years later, in 1962, I undertook my doctoral work in that same group at Harvard. At that time, several of my fellow students were still using the methods Starr had pioneered. From Harvard, Starr went on to a postgraduate position in the Magnet Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he added cryogenics and magnetic measurements to his portfolio of experimental skills. In 1940, he took a post with the US Navy\u2019s Bureau of Mines, leading a group of engineers analysing pressurewave propagation from mine explosions and exploring the effects of these waves on various hull geometries. Immediately after Pearl Harbor, he and a colleague tried to enlist in the army, but were told that what they were doing would be a greater contribution to the war effort than fighting in foxholes. Word of Starr\u2019s technical and leadership skills spread throughout the then small community of American physicists, and in 1942 he was invited to join the staff of E. O. Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley. Lawrence\u2019s intention (largely unknown to Starr at the time) was to train him in the principles of cyclotron resonance for eventual reassignment to the \u2018calutron\u2019 or \u2018racetrack\u2019 uranium-235 separation project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which at the time was not reaching its production goals. Lawrence asked Starr to form and lead a team of several hundred engineers, to troubleshoot the early-production calutrons through experiments performed on a smallscale model he was to construct. The ensuing improvements were incorporated into new production machines, and by the spring of OBITUARY", "authors": ["P.

Although this new group consists of relative outsiders, I argue that it is growing in influence as a source of ideas about China\u2019s future\u2014and the world\u2019s future\u2014that can push Beijing to be more assertive. To see how proclamations of building a harmonious world contributed to China\u2019s current conflicts with its Asian neighbors and Western powers, it is necessary to trace how Hu\u2019s foreign policy encourages China\u2019s officials and its citizen intellectuals to talk about post-American world orders. To explore this debate, the essay will compare Beijing\u2019s official view of \u201cbuilding a harmonious world\u201d with the views of two citizen intellectuals regarding China\u2019s future and the world\u2019s future. The works compared are Professor Zhao Tingyang\u2019s Tianxia Tixi: Shijie Zhidu Zhexue Daolun (The Tianxia System: The philosophy for the world institution) (2005) and Senior Colonel Liu Mingfu\u2019s Zhongguo Meng: Hou Meiguo Shidai de Daguo Siwei Zhanl\u00fce Dingwei (The China dream: The Great Power thinking and strategic positioning of China in the post-American age) (2010).2 The Tianxia System uses traditional Chinese ideas to craft a new world order; The China Dream argues that the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) needs a military rise to guard its economic rise. These two books are important because they exemplify how popular voices increasingly influence debate among foreign policy experts. They each became social phenomena and media events that provoked debates, which spread their influence far beyond their core audiences of philosophers and military officers into China\u2019s broader civil society. The Tianxia System and The China Dream thus are important because they have been widely discussed alongside more mainstream approaches in academic journals and newspapers, as well as through the new media of blogs and electronic bulletin boards.3 In 2.

Indeed, in many ways it is best to understand them in terms of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s slogan from the early reform era: \u201cSocialism with Chinese Characteristics.\u201d Many argue that China\u2019s ideology has shifted from \u201csocialism\u201d to \u201cChinese characteristics.\u201d However, this essay will show how alternative world orders each entail a productive tension between \u201csocialism\u201d and \u201cChinese characteristics.\u201d Socialism is not dead in China; although its power as a revolutionary ideology is weak, it is thriving as a lifestyle and a way of thinking that continues to inform discussions of things like the \u201cChina model\u201d and the \u201cBeijing Consensus.\u201d5 Even with its many problems, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is not about to collapse: it is the wealthiest political party in the world, has 80 million members, and is growing. Although Chinese nationalism is strong and Confucianism is a growing force, Chinese tradition does not dominate the discussion of \u201cChinese characteristics\u201d as much as people in the West might think. It is necessary, then, to pay attention to the nuance of foreign policy discussions in China to see how realism, idealism, and liberalism are combined in a range of different ways.

In other words, although predictions of American decline are popular, the U.S. is still likely to dominate global affairs for the next few decades. China\u2019s strategic futures are important, however, because they show how Chinese officials and citizen intellectuals are starting to think beyond the current world system to craft post-American world orders. Their impact thus may be more negative than positive; even if such alternative world orders are not realized, they still can serve to delegitimize Americaninfluenced global norms. For a period of time, then, the international politics would be in a disorderly interregnum between dominant world systems.7 The essay will argue two points: (1) Hu\u2019s harmonious world foreign policy has had unintended consequences: it has created opportunities for citizens to talk about a wide range of possibili", "authors": ["William A.

European leaders, therefore, should join those who insist that President Nazarbayev appoint a successor while still in good health and in power. In addition to this, liberal-minded figures among political and business elites should be encouraged and supported, while educational and exchange opportunities for youth expanded.

In June-July a wave of armed attacks and bombings followed in Aktobe and capital Astana. The government reacted by tightening control and passing an \u201cantiradicalisation\u201d bill, which the militants countered by additional attacks. Previously unknown Islamist group, Jund-al-Khalifa, claimed responsibility for attacks, earning itself extensive coverage in the media. Sporadic fighting continued till beginning of December, when it subsided. In late December a longunresolved labor dispute turned violent in the town of Zhanaozen in western Kazakhstan. Oil workers from Ozenmunaigas, a subsidiary of national oil giant KazMunaiGaz, had been on a prolonged strike since July 2011. The six-month standoff between oil workers and trade union activists on one hand and local government and company management on the other was ignored by central officials. The wage calculation dispute quickly escalated into wider protest as company management and local administration used courts, police and thugs to intimidate strikers and pressure them out of protest. Opposition used the opportunity to criticize central government and publicly offer assistance to strikers, turning what was initially a labor dispute into a political standoff. On December 16, the Independence Day, local officials were arranging for a celebration on the main square, then long occupied by the strikers. It appears that strikers responded aggressively to the plan of festivities, destroying the rally stage, loudspeakers and setting posters on fire. By some accounts, paid \u201cprovocateurs\u201d were involved in turning the strike into mass violence. The police had to use weapons, leading to 15 deaths (70 by some estimates) and many more injured. As the protests were brutally broken up in Zhanaozen, another, a more violent one broke out in the neighboring village of Shetpe on December 17, and was also dispersed using firearms. In both Zhanaozen and Shetpe angry protesters were accused of destroying government buildings and property and putting fire on local prosecutor\u2019s office and oil firm\u2019s offices. On December 18 and 19 two thousand gathered in the regional center Aktau on a peaceful rally to stop violence in Zhanaozen and Shetpe. The government\u2019s reaction to Zhanaozen challenge was fast and \u201ctraditional\u201d. On December 16, as initial protests broke out, all communications lines were blocked and troops were mobilized. Police prevented travel of outsiders to the town and several activists were arrested for demonstrating against police brutality in Almaty, the largest and most contentious city. On December 17, the police arrested seventy in Zhanaozen and Nazarbayev declared the state of emergency and curfew in the district. Prosecutor General issued a statement calling protests acts of \u201chooliganism\u201d 2 Office of the Prosecutor General later claimed communication blockade was a technical issue caused by a damaged cable and not a deliberate government act. . Government also clamped down on violent dissent in the neighboring village of Shetpe, but showed restraints with peaceful demonstrators in Aktau. Nazarbayev initially supported actions of the police against \u201cbanditry\u201d, whom he carefully distinguished from striking oilmen. Seemingly, he did not find Zhanaozen riots grave 3 Prosecutor\u2019s Office consistently referred to government challengers as \u201chooligans\u201d, though their alleged actions (arson, firing into policemen, destroying government buildings, plunder, blocking transport) should ideally have been qualified as a more serious type of crime. enough to cancel his official trip to Moscow. Alarmed by Islamist insurgency and deadly strikes by oilmen in western Mangistau, foreign media was quick to point to \u201cshaken stability\u201d and \u201ccracks in social contract\u201d. US Helsinki Commission held a talk on instability in Kazakhstan and International Crisis Group put Kazakhstan in \u201cdeteriorating situations\u201d category. The American volunteer organization, the Peace Corps, called back its volunteers in November 2011. But how real is the political danger? Are protests a harbinger of turbulent changes to come or a one-time event, well managed and killed off by the incumbents? Will any such events follow and what would be their scale? Where is the bigger threat to stability in Kazakhstan \u2013 among the wide masses or among those in top? What are the prospects for a change in Kazakhstan, given the zeitgeist of Arab Spring and Russian electoral protests? The easiest and most obvious way to proceed would be to look at the past and see if Nazarbayev faced any similar challenges in his presidency and how he managed them. However, past is a very bad predictor of the future, so while some scenarios would be elaborated, making forecasts is close to impossible in a closed information space like Kazakhstan\u2019s and any scenarios base on a ceteris paribus assumption. Analysis of past (perceived) threats to the incumbent First, when Kazakhstan reluctantly declared independence in December 1991 there were wellgrounded concerns that ethnic Slavs dominating North Kazakhstan would secede and join Russian Federation should the newly-empowered ethnic Kazakh elites push too hard on ethnic nation-building. Unlike other Central Asian ethnicities, KaISPI Policy Brief 3 zakhs were not the majority in \u201ctheir\u201d country and most of the Russian-speaking Slavic minorities (Russian and Ukrainians) were concentrated in the north of the country. President Nazarbayev successfully navigated between rising Kazakh ethno-nationalism and formal ideology of multiculturalism and over time eliminated the threat of Russian secession through encouraging internal migration of ethnic Kazakhs to the North, securing Russian Federation\u2019s support for its territorial integrity and political disempowerment of separatist forces in the North. Secession is not a threat anymore and Nazarbayev takes due credit for that. Second, similar to Russia\u2019s Boris Yeltsin, Nazarbayev had to deal with a non-compliant parliament in early nineties. Following the Russian example, Nazarbayev secured \u201cvoluntary\u201d dissolution of the parliament in December 1993, accusing it of blocking economic reforms Though most of the new MPs were staunch supporters of Nazarbayev, the second parliament also ended up disappointing him. Unhappy with the pace and mode of economic reforms, the majority of deputies handed a vote of no-confidence to the Premier. When Nazarbayev ignored the vote, a more radical faction called for Nazarbayev\u2019s resignation as well. A number of laws vetoed by Nazarbayev were overridden by parliamentary majority. Faced with such a contentious parliament, Nazarbayev had to bow to demands of MPs and fire his Premier. . The new parliament was elected under very tight government control and with Communist party banned from running. 4 M. BRILL OLCOTT, Kazakhstan: Unfulfilled Promise?, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2007, p. 102. Following this standoff, there was a seven-months-long political deadlock, with parliament acting populist and incoherent, which Nazarbayev ended through Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling that elections of 1994 were illegitimate and dissolving the parliament in March 1995. He ruled by decree for nine months, till the new Constitution was adopted in August 1995, necessitating new elections to the legislature and extending his tenure till 2000. Third big challenge to Nazarbayev regime came when a number of prominent businessmen and government officials wrote an open letter to Nazarbayev accusing his son-in-law, Rakhat Aliev, of corruption and usurping power. Signatories to the document also organized \u201cDemocratic Choice of Kazakhstan\u201d (DCK) movement to promote political reforms and limit powers of presidency and presidential family\u2019s growing influence. This was the first case of open defiance of elites against president Nazarbayev. The president acted decisively, publicly defending his son-in-law and condemning DCK. Enraged Premier Tokayev demanded that government officials who signed the letter immediately resign, but Nazarbayev simply fired them. Two members of the DCK, Mukhtar Ablyazov and Galymzhan Zhakiyanov, were subsequently arrested and imprisoned for one and four years, respectively. Following the DCK scandal Premier Tokayev had to resign, while Aliev was sent off to Vienna as an ambassador. The fourth and fifth political challenges were scandals popularly known as \u201cKazakhgate\u201d and \u201cRakhatgate\u201d. Kazakhgate scandal, involving a prominent New York banker and trader James Giffen, unfolded in 2003, when Gi", "authors": ["Anvar Rahmetov"], "citations": 1, "venue": "", "year": 2012}, "9": {"title": "Don\u2019t Fear the Reaper: The Purpose of Religious Festivals in Ancient Rome", "abstract": "This paper discusses the way the political leaders of Rome during the periods of the late Republic and early Empire used religious festivals as a way of gaining and maintaining power among the citizens. This article is available in Constructing the Past: http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/constructing/vol12/iss1/13 Don\u2019t Fear the Reaper: The Purpose of Ancestor Worship in Ancient Rome Emily Susina The ancient Roman practice of ancestor worship served as a way to \u201censure, through the medium of devout attention to their mortal relics in the tomb, comfort, refreshment, and perennial renewal of life to [the] immortal spirits.\u201d 11 The Romans believed that the spirit could live on after death, and it needed to be nourished just as it would were it still in a body. Through the practices and festivals associated with ancestor worship during the late Republic and early Empire, the leaders of Rome were able to take advantage of citizens\u2019 fears of invoking the wrath of the city\u2019s Lares to ensure that the citizens complied with the laws and traditions of the city. Such practices also allowed various leaders of Rome to push their agendas. Furthermore, the practice of sacrificing to the spirits was not only for the benefit of the dead; it also allowed ideas to be passed down through generations so that none of the experiences or knowledge of the ancestors would ever truly be lost. In believing that ancestors could communicate from beyond the grave, Roman citizens were able to continue to gain insight to situations from the city\u2019s elders long after they had left their mortal bodies. Leaders also likely used this concept in order to ensure compliance with traditional notions of Roman values and duties. Therefore, ancestor worship and its associated beliefs and festivals played an important cultural, social, and political role in ancient Rome and also allowed Roman leaders to exert a certain degree of control over citizens. In the ancient Roman belief system, the Lar is \u201cthe single deified founder of a family.\u201d 22 The Romans did not believe that the founders of their families should merely be respected or honored; instead, they thought that these ancestors should be literally worshipped as gods. Each family was responsible for worshiping and appeasing its own Lares in order to prevent hardship within the family. The title \u201cLares\u201d separated these spirits from the rest of the ancestors, referred to as the di parentes, which reminded citizens that the Lares were held in a higher regard than the rest of the dead. Each household would have had its own personal Lares, which would have been honored in a sacred part of the house known as the lararium. 33 In addition to maintaining the lararium and paying homage to their own Lares, all Roman citizens were also responsible for worshipping and honoring the city\u2019s Lares, known as the Lares Praestites. The Lares Praestites were usually depicted as young twin men, and they were often shown with a dog standing between them. In some cases, \u201cthe Lares themselves [were] dressed in dog-skins.\u201d 4 This portrayal of the Lares with a dog represented their roles as guardians of the city. The Lares were responsible for keeping the citizens safe and could be considered the cause of any hardship the city underwent. The citizens had to make sure to constantly appease the Lares to ensure that they would not turn on the city. If the Lares were angered, they could let harm come to both the citizens and the city itself. In addition to protecting the city, the Lares were also thought to be important for its success and well-being. On occasion, the Romans would ask the Lares to bless the fields before planting because they assumed \u201cif [the Lares] represent the souls of deified ancestors, they 1 J. M. C. Toynbee, Death and Burial in the Roman World (New York: Cornell University Press, 1971), 62. 2 Margaret C. Waites, \"The Nature of the Lares and their Representation in Roman Art,\" American Journal of Archaeology 24.3 (1920): 245. 3 Lesley Adkins and Roy A. Adkins, Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome (New York: Facts on File, Inc., 1994), 274. 4 Waites, \u201cNature of the Lares,\u201d 250. were... able, like other chthonic deities, to bring increase to the crops.\u201d 5 The Lares played an especially important role in major events such as wars, but they were also thought to be necessary in everyday events. For this reason, the Romans had to be sure to appease the spirits of the ancestors not only in trying times, but also in daily life. Just as failing to honor the Lares during war could cause devastation and destruction, neglecting the Lares in times of peace could cause a bad harvest or a drought. These important spirits were typically honored through \u201clibations regularly poured out... at Roman banquets... and offering to the Lares any food accidentally dropped at the table.\u201d 6 Citizens would make small sacrifices to the city\u2019s Lares at every official Roman banquet. In addition to these frequent, minor sacrifices, the Lares were worshipped and celebrated at festivals throughout the year. There was a festival dedicated specifically to the Lares each year in December, as well as festivals dedicated to all of the spirits and ancestors at several different times each year. The most important festival for the worship of the Lares was the Parentalia, which was \u201cthe feast... of parents and other kinsfolk of individual families.\u201d 7 The festival was a time to celebrate and worship one\u2019s ancestors as the protectors of the family. The last day of this festival, the Feralia, was the \u201cbest known of these days, and the only one which was a public festival.\u201d 8 The Feralia may have been the most important day of the Parentalia, but the festival actually lasted for more than a week each year, from February 13 to February 21. During this time, life within the city was dedicated almost completely to the celebration of the festival and the worship of the ancestors. For the duration of the Parentalia, \u201call temples were closed, marriages were forbidden, and magistrates appeared without their insignia.\u201d 9 5 Ibid., 244. 6 Lily Ross Taylor, \"The Mother of the Lares,\" American Journal of Archaeology 29.3 (1925): 30.1 7 Toynbee, Death and Burial, 64. 8 Fowler, Roman Festivals, 306. 9 Ibid., 308. Daily life as the Romans knew it ceased for the festival; it was more important to maintain a good relationship with the spirits of the ancestors than it was to continue with the typical types of worship and commonplace legal activities. The one similarity between all these celebrations is that they were all state-sponsored. In this way, the Roman leaders were able to control the citizens\u2019 actions and mandate the types of things that they must do for the ancestral spirits. Through these festivals, the leaders taught Roman citizens how to properly sacrifice to the spirits of the city. This compliance would likely have carried over from following rituals related to the Lares to following the laws and traditions of the city in general, which thus ensured that citizens would continue to follow the regulations of the city. Because there was no separation between church and state in ancient Rome, the political leaders were thus able to use religious beliefs and festivals to regulate the behaviors of Roman citizens. In his Fasti, Ovid also elaborates on the Roman reasons for ancestor worship and the various festivals associated with such worship. According to Ovid, failing to honor the dead could cause \u201cancestral spirits [to come] moaning from their tombs in the dead of night.\u201d 10 Appeasing the ancestors was the only way to ensure that they would not return to wreak havoc on the city and cause major hardships. At the Feralia, the citizens would \u201cbear/ Offerings to the dead... to propitiate the shades.\u201d 11 On this day, the Romans would offer sacrifices in honor of the ancestors to satisfy the demands of the ancestral spirits. This practice could be used to assuage both personal Lares, and the city\u2019s Lares. Although the Parentalia focused more on personal Lares than on the city Lares, the citizens would still have learned the proper rituals for sacrifice and worship so they could apply them to the city Lares as well. Ovid also points out in this work that the sacrifices that were given were also believed to have originated at the foundation of the city by writing that \u201cthis custom was brought to your lands, just Latinus,/ By Aeneas.\u201d 12 This legitimizes the necessity of worshipping the Lares by reminding the Roman citizens both about the foundation of the city and that ancestor worship was not a new idea \u2013 the tradition was brought to Italy by Aeneas when he brought his family\u2019s Lares with him as he fled from Troy. In reading Ovid\u2019s works, it is important to consider not only the content of the writing, but also the social context of his situation. Ovid originally dedicated Fasti to Augustus, so everything he wrote in that work would have been in an attempt to win Augustus\u2019 approval. Writing for Augustus could have caused Ovid to have been more concerned with following the letter of the law rather than his own personal opinions. It could also indicate that Augustus wanted the citizens to follow the law more closely. Ovid would essentially have been relaying Augustus\u2019 message to the people of Rome, so it is entirely possible that it was Augustus who wanted to remind the citizens that when the earlier Romans had \u201cneglected the Parentalia, Festival of the Dead, such deeds did not go unpunished.\u201d 13 In this way, Augustus could have used Ovid\u2019s works as a tool to spread messages warning the Romans of the consequences of disobeying the laws and traditions of the city. After all, if the ancestors were not treated properly, they could quickly turn on the city and it was not until \u201cneglected honour was paid to the tombs/ [that] there was an end to the portents.\u201d 14 Once the Roman citizens gave the appropriate sacrifices to the ancestors, the spirits would stop tormenting the city.

However, when a new MCHH edition is released, those with the previous editions do not have access to the updated information. A mobile app is an appealing platform to fill this gap. We developed a mobile app called \u201cKhunLook\u201d as an interactive electronic MCHH intended to assist parents in child health supervision. Objective This study describes the user requirements and development of the KhunLook mobile app, validity of parents\u2019 growth assessments, and parents\u2019 evaluation of feasibility and acceptability of the app. Methods Phase 1 was a qualitative study using individual interviews. The interview data were used to revise the prototype. In phase 2, parents were randomly assigned to assess their children\u2019s growth with the app or the MCHH. The outcomes were compared to those of the physician\u2019s assessment, and congruence was determined. In phase 3, parents evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of the app in comparison to the MCHH through a web-based survey. Results Four health care providers and 8 parents participated in phase 1. Two themes were identified: (1) the mobile app potentially counters parents\u2019 infrequent use of the MCHH with accuracy, attractiveness, convenience, and simplicity, and (2) health supervision needs to be standard, up-to-date, and understandable. KhunLook was publicly launched with a family page and 7 key features: growth and nutrition, development, immunizations, oral health, reminders for the next appointment, memories, and health advice. In phase 2, 56 parents participated in the growth parameter assessments; 34 were in the App group and 22 in the MCHH group. The outcomes of the growth parameter assessments between parents and physicians in both the App and MCHH groups were not significantly different. The congruence proportions were higher in the App group for weight and head circumference, but the differences were not statistically significant. In phase 3, 356 parents from all over Thailand participated in a web-based survey. Parents rated the app feasibility as \u201cvery easy to easy\u201d to use at higher proportions than the MCHH in all health assessment domains (growth, development, and immunizations) and ease-of-use domains with statistical significance (P<.001). The KhunLook app received a significantly higher mean score (8.59/10) than the MCHH (7.6/10) (P<.001). Most parents (317/356, 89.0%) preferred the app over MCHH. Further, 93.5% (333/356) of the parents stated that they would continue to use the app and 96.9% (345/356) would recommend others to use it. Conclusions KhunLook, a Thai mobile app for child health supervision, was developed, validated for growth assessments, and was well accepted for ease-of-use by parents.

Several weeks later, the American Cancer Society released a statement encouraging individuals to postpone cancer screenings.1 Routine pediatric visits were postponed or canceled, and emergency rooms were reserved for the sickest patients requiring emergent evaluation. Pediatric emergency room visits and pediatric hospital inpatient censuses significantly decreased. Patients with new onset diabetes presented with diabetic ketoacidosis for fear of exposure to health care institutions.2 Patients with appendicitis were noted to have delayed presentation and higher rates of complications.3 The Children\u2019s Hospital at Montefiore, an urban academic tertiary care hospital with a designated oncology floor, is the only Children\u2019s Hospital in the Bronx, the boroughwith the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City.4 The volume of patients admitted to Montefiore Medical Center at the height of the pandemic was so large that one floor of the Children\u2019s Hospital was converted into a unit for adult COVID patients, as were several conference rooms. We hypothesized that fewer pediatric cancers presented to the hospital during this time. We conducted a retrospective chart review of the number and type of new cancer diagnoses that presented to our hospital during March through June 2020 and compared it to these samemonths during each of the previous 5 years. During themonths ofMarch-May 2015-2019, we saw an average of 13.6 \u00b1 4.5 (mean \u00b1 SD) new solid tumor diagnoses (Table 1). In 2020, we saw no new diagnoses in March or May; in April we saw only four new patients with solid tumors, three of whom were sarcoma patients who presented with a long duration of symptom and were found to have metastatic disease. The fourth child had a brainstem glioma. These patients were each diagnosed and treated urgently, without any delay secondary to COVID-19. In contrast, during that same period we had an average of 5.2 \u00b1 1.2 (mean \u00b1 SD) new leukemia diagnoses, and saw four new leukemia patients during the pandemic in 2020. In contrast, in June 2020 we saw three new leukemia patients and six new patients with solid tumors (one sacrococcygeal teratoma, one renal cell carcinoma, one medulloblastoma, one CNS germinoma, and two patients withWilms tumor).

A Roadmap for Delivering Child Care in Agricultural Communities", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose: The \u201cProtecting Children While Parents Work in Agriculture\u201d project aims to establish safe and nurturing environments for farmworker children while their parents work. Access to good child care aids worker recruitment, improves retention, and boosts morale. However, childcare services are sometimes nonexistent, cost prohibitive, or not available when needed. Ensuring adequate services is best accomplished when childcare providers, agricultural employers, and farmworker parents work together. The Roadmap for Delivering Child Care in Agricultural Communities (Roadmap) was developed to facilitate this collaboration. Results/Findings: This project conducted focus groups, surveys, and interviews with agribusiness representatives, childcare providers, and farmworker parents. This formative research found that 90% of surveyed agribusinesses believe providing childcare services to employees\u2019 children fosters a more stable workforce, improves employee morale, and enhances company reputation. About half indicated they need guidance on how to implement these services. Interviews with childcare providers indicated that access to child care could improve with representation by the grower community. Farmworker parents stated they were more likely to choose a job in a location with childcare services, and more women would choose to work if child care was available. With these findings, the project team drafted the Roadmap, a step-by-step guide for developing childcare facilities and improving existing childcare services and access to services. It also includes evidence supporting successful agricultural safety and health interventions and how adequate child care is a beneficial investment for agribusinesses and farmworkers alike. It was reviewed by childcare providers, growers, and farmworker advocates, who all agreed the Roadmap is a useful resource they recommend to others. The project team used their feedback to refine the Roadmap language and content and provide recommendations for dissemination. To promote this to key stakeholders, the team developed a promotional video, social media toolkit, and a media release. Practical Application: Growers and other stakeholders can use the Roadmap to facilitate improved access to childcare services for their employees, including creating new childcare options. Stakeholders are encouraged to distribute this handbook in regions with large numbers of hired agricultural workers and to facilitate linkages between growers and childcare providers.", "authors": ["A.

In addition to the trauma of suffering a burn, the painful and intrusive medical procedures required to treat them can impact on the developing child cognitively, emotionally, psychologically, and socially. A child\u2019s burn injuries and their treatment can also have a significant psychosocial impact on parents, affecting their health and mental well-being. Parents can experience a reactive distress including elevated stress, anger, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, guilt, marital and financial problems, and increased responsibility and load, during the acute phase of treatment. Many must also divide their time to meet the needs of any uninjured siblings, and between work, the hospital, and home. This PhD used mixed methods to explore the experiences, access to support, opinions of peer support, and support needs amongst parents and carers of burn-injured children. Thirteen interviews were conducted with parents, followed by a survey of a further 57 parents. The majority of parents reported that they were offered support, particularly during the acute phase of treatment. Most often, this was from nursing staff. Despite this, many parents also reported to feel isolated. Access to peer support has been recommended in the British Burn Care Standards (2013, 2018), and parents recognised the potential value of this. However, factors such as guilt, the pain of recollection, perceived stigma, time pressures, and distance to the hospital can make accessing such support difficult. The results of this research suggested that online delivery of supportive peer-informed information could be particularly appealing to parents, particularly that which retained the peer voice. With widespread access to the internet and growing dependence on computers and mobile devices, it is common for adults in the UK to seek health-related support and information on the Internet. Many parents involved in this research had searched online for burn-related information following their child\u2019s injury but found this to be lacking. Therefore, using a partnership-based method of website development, www.SupportingChildrenWithBurns.co.uk was developed and tested with nine parents and 22 professionals before being publicly released and accessed worldwide.

Marshburn The CDC informed the American media of the best way to avoid contributing to imitative suicides by releasing guidelines for suicide reports in 2001. In this study, suicide reports in the New York Times were examined to establish if these guidelines affected the reporting. To determine if there was any change, all suicide reports from five years before, the year of guideline release, and five years after were extracted from the Times database. To determine compliance, articles were coded using a coding sheet that operationalized the guidelines into 12 yes-or-no questions. The New York Times observed nearly one and a half guidelines more in 2006 than 10 years before, from about 5 to nearly 6.5 observed. Some guidelines were observed differently in 2001, suggesting greater focus on the topic. However, only some of the changes were in line with the guidelines, and none of them lasted five years. Some guidelines, such as those to include intervention resources, conflicted with journalism norms and were never followed. Others, like the one discouraging front page placement, fell in line with the journalism standards of the New York Times and so were always followed. On the whole, the change in 2001 suggests that the guidelines did have an effect, but it was mixed and did not last five years. The increased observance overall suggests that the evolving standards of the New York Times agreed more with the media guidelines over the ten years.

The developed world has evolved many models for elderly care, for example, nursing home care, health insurance, etc. Indian Government has also taken multiple measures in this direction by initiating National Policy on Older Persons, 1999, the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, the Old Age Pension Scheme, Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana 2017, etc. However, there is a necessity that, India must rapidly adapt to the complex health related, social and economic challenges caused by these demographic changes. This may be an opportunity for innovation in the health system by developing a perspective for healthy and active aging, though it is a major challenge. Health care of the older people cannot be achieved unless total health, i.e., physical, social, economic, psychological, and spiritual aspects are addressed. Objective: The objective is to study current policies regarding geriatric health care in India and to propose the possibility to develop a model to provide comprehensive and dedicated health-care services to the older population by integrating conventional and indigenous systems of medicine dwelling in the country. Materials and methods: Electronic search in various scientific journals for research and review articles; electronic along with hand searching of conference proceedings, brochures, government policy documents, press releases, Ayurveda classical texts, etc., regarding geriatric health care in India and model health-care facilities in other countries and regarding of AYUSH systems in geriatric health care in India. Results: There is an urgent need of adaptation and modification in the National Health System to cater the actual requirements of the elderly with plans and strategies dedicated to face their health-related challenges. Adoption of inclusive health-care interventions, can improve health outcomes by making it more acceptable, accessible, and affordable.

Daily corticosteroid replacement therapy is the standard treatment. Other adrenal diseases that can result in adrenal insufficiency are for instance ACTH independent Cushing\u2019s syndrome (after treatment) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Care for patients with adrenal disease has improved enormously in the past 10 years. A great deal of research has been carried out. There has been intensive collaboration between patient associations and healthcare professionals to ensure better care and to ensure that patients and their carers/parents are better informed about the disorder. Despite a clearer understanding of the importance of more precise replacement therapy, patients are still reporting a reduced quality of life. Their \u2018complaints\u2019 in this context relate not only to physical symptoms such as fatigue or muscle and joint pain, but also to psychosocial problems [1] especially in patients with comorbidity. Psychological wellbeing has increasingly been the subject of research during the last decade. The key factors for improving quality of life are early diagnosis, improved dosage of medication (3\u20134 times daily) and increased self-management and knowledge about the disorder for both patients and their immediate circle of carers. New medications like slow-release and modified release hydrocortisone preparations and hydrocortisone tablets with lower dosages improve and better reflect the naturally occurring circadian endogenous release of glucocorticoids [2]. At the same time, steps have been taken towards research that will improve the psychological support and the quality of life for patients. A close collaboration between the patient associations and the healthcare professionals will ensure a better care through education. In addition, various aids have been developed to give patients and healthcare practitioners a better understanding of the disorder and help them take the necessary actions in times of increased stress. It has become clear that good education of the patient and his/her close relatives and better cooperation between the patient and the healthcare practitioners is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [3]. About 10 years ago an emergency card was developed in Sweden based on the idea is that patients should carry the card for their own safety so that it can be shown to healthcare providers (GPs, ambulance crews, emergency room staff, etc.) in the event of an emergency. By making it known that the patient suffers from an adrenal disease, a stress medication schedule can be instigated immediately to avoid a life-threatening adrenal crisis. At the request of the Swedish doctors and with the blessing of the ESE and the ESPE in 2015, AdrenalNET developed this card into what it is now\u2014the standard European Emergency Card. The card is produced in two editions, a paediatric and an adult version, in no <17 countries [4]. Besides the large-scale production of the physical plastic European Emergency Card, individual patients can download a template from www.adrenals.eu and print a card for their own use. This website also offers a selection of information and instruction material in several languages for patients. The collaboration between German, Scandinavian, and Dutch parties has proven to be beneficial to improve the education, the knowledge, and thus the position of individual patients and their carers/parents.

Primary Care Providers (PCPs) play a crucial role in treating obesity by providing family-based behavioral weight management counseling and by educating patients and their families about the health concerns associated with obesity. Despite the significant role that PCPs play within treating childhood obesity, little is known about PCPs\u2019 perceptions of their efficacy in treating this condition. Through individual semi-structured interviews, this study\u2019s aims were to obtain a greater understanding of PCPs\u2019: 1) perceptions of the education and training they received to treat childhood obesity; 2) perceptions of their abilities and efficacy in applying this knowledge to treat childhood obesity; and 3) approach to initiating conversations about obesity with families and strategies they employ to motivate families to take action about their child\u2019s weight status. Seven physicians were interviewed in person and one was interviewed via phone. The interview from six physicians were recorded, transcribed and then analyzed for common themes. This prospective, qualitative study established three key themes about PCPs\u2019 perceptions of childhood obesity (1) A well-established rapport and clear information about obesity percentiles are crucial to start conversations about childhood obesity, (2) A toxic environment is a major obstacle in the treatment of childhood obesity and (3)\u200b \u200bPhysicians feel competent in providing diet/nutrition counseling and exercise counseling.\u200b \u200bFurthermore, this research identified potential improvements such as more patient-centered care that may help to improve treatment and related health outcomes. Keywords\u200b: Primary Care Providers, Perceptions, Barriers, Childhood Obesity Views on Treating Childhood Obesity 3 Background: Childhood obesity is \u201ca multisystem disease with potentially devastating consequences\u201d (Ebbeling, Pawlak, & Ludwig, 2002)\u200b. As children who struggle with obesity grow older, they may face a multitude of chronic health conditions such as hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, asthma, and adverse psychosocial effects \u200b(Ebbeling et al., 2002)\u200b. Treatments and prevention plans that are geared to early detection and long-lasting results can help combat the epidemic of childhood obesity and prevent life-threatening consequences. The battle to treat childhood obesity involves the entire community all working together to combat this pervasive health problem that is affecting the United States. In 2005, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) established that the Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile of an individual is a useful tool to determine obesity not only in adults but also in children \u200b(US Preventive Services Task Force et al., 2017)\u200b. BMI percentile is an easy way to diagnose obesity due to the ease of obtaining weight and height data for children. Children\u2019s BMI percentile is determined by comparing their height and weight and comparing it to children of matching age and sex. For children aged 219 years, obesity is defined as a BMI at or above the 95\u200bth\u200b percentile \u200b(Warren et al., 2018)\u200b. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) estimates that within the United States, 18.5% of children aged 2-19 have obesity; this value is the highest rate ever documented by NHANES \u200b(Warren et al., 2018)\u200b. Even more astounding is the fact that the overall obesity rate has more than tripled since the 1976-1980 NHANES data \u200b(Warren et al., 2018)\u200b. At the city level in Philadelphia, the statistics are even more worrisome. In 2018, the Department of Public Health for the city of Philadelphia released a report predicting that the Views on Treating Childhood Obesity 4 current childhood obesity rate for the city was 21.9% for 5-18-year-olds \u200b(Health of the City 2018, n.d.)\u200b, placing Philadelphia\u2019s estimated childhood obesity rate higher than the national average. The city of Philadelphia has passed initiatives that take into account the role of schools, communities, and families in the battle against childhood obesity. This is a crucial step in treating obesity considering how there are many causes of obesity including social, environmental and genetic factors. Social and environmental factors can result in behavioral changes that need to be addressed appropriately for treatment. Access to diets with \u201cincreased caloric consumption such as sugar-sweetened beverages, sweet snacks, fast food containing excess fat, large portion sizes, and high glycemic foods\u201d can lead to the excess fat that is definitive of obesity \u200b(Kumar & Kelly, 2017)\u200b.\u200b \u200bBesides the increased consumption of certain highly caloric but nutrient poor foods, other environmental factors such as reduced physical activity and increased sedentary time in the digital age are also directly related to the prevalence of obesity in children \u200b(Kumar & Kelly, 2017)\u200b.\u200b Along with these factors, an individual's genetics can also influence their predisposition to obesity. The genetics of a person may influence \u201c\u200b the metabolism, by changing the body fat content and energy intake and energy expenditure\u201d \u200b(Karnik & Kanekar, 2012)\u200b. Treatment needs to take into account the individual differences and the social and environmental factors that influence one's health. Philadelphia has made great strides to take these various factors into account when implementing preventative measures. The city has successfully seen a \u201c6.5% decline in the obesity rate for students in grades K-12 from 2006-07 to 2012-13\u201d partly due to the initiatives that have opened new farmers\u2019 market, increased physical activity in schools, and increased Views on Treating Childhood Obesity 5 access to healthier snacks and meals \u200b(CDC Community Profile Philadelphia, PA Communities Putting Prevention to Work, n.d.; Rate Decline: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \u2013 The State of Obesity, n.d.)\u200b. The city has demonstrated how schools, communities, and the environment can all be involved in improving children\u2019s health. The city has not, however, fully utilized the impact of primary care providers in treatment and prevention strategies. \u200bOne of the first suggestions of Primary Care Providers (PCPs) is \u200bto advocate for children to eat less and be more physically active to lose weight \u200b(Ebbeling et al., 2002)\u200b. The primary treatment for obesity includes dietary adjustments, increased physical activity, and behavioral modifications, while secondary treatment can use pharmaceuticals or surgery \u200b(Rippe, McInnis, & Melanson, 2001)\u200b. Many of the recommendations require lifestyle changes on the part of the family, school, and community that these children eat, live and play in. Physicians can be instrumental in advising parents about appropriate diets while parents and schools are typically in charge of providing children with different meals. Primary care providers can be instrumental in not only diagnosing childhood obesity but also providing parents with necessary information about healthful eating, activity patterns, body weight and connect them with the community resources \u200b(Sherwood et al., 2013)\u200b. Sherwood, et al., (2013) addresses just how community environment, schools, neighborhood context, primary care clinics, family environment, and child behavior all influence a child\u2019s weight status. Primary care physicians and primary care clinics can help provide a multidisciplinary approach to obesity treatment and weight management that can help patients get personalized treatment and care (Rippe et al., 2001)\u200b. In 2005, a combination of 15 national health care organization collaborated with the American Medical Association, CDC, and the Health Resources and Services Views on Treating Childhood Obesity 6 Administration to form an expert committee which recommended a multidisciplinary approach within the primary care office as well as family involvement to treat and prevent childhood obesity \u200b(Jortberg et al., 2016)\u200b. Despite being aware of the value and importance that primary care providers can have in the treatment of childhood obesity, it is unclear as to how successful these PCPs are in providing appropriate care. PCPs often encourage patients and their family to improve their diet but \u201conly 14% of resident physicians reported being adequately trained to provide nutritional counseling\u201d \u200b(Baute, Sampath-Kumar, Nelson, & Basil, 2018)\u200b. This statistic is surprising considering how other research suggests that PCPs (about 81%) \u201cclaimed that they spent 11\u201320 min per well visit during the first 2 years, and 79% stated they discussed diet, nutrition, and exercise for greater than 3 minutes\u201d \u200b(Spivack, Swietlik, Alessandrini, & Faith, 2010)\u200b. This same study demonstrated that out of the eighty pediatricians and seven nurse practitioners that responded to the questionnaire, only a minority correctly identified (26%) the definition and prevalence (9%) of children who are overweight \u200b(Spivack et al., 2010)\u200b. When PCPs are unable to even identify children who are overweight, and at a higher risk of obesity, it is difficult to expect them to provide adequate care. Even medical students identified student-centered actions (e.g., lack of knowledge) as a barrier to preventing and treating childhood obesity along with Patient-centered (e.g., lack of access), and health system-centered barriers (e.g., limited time) \u200b(Cooke, Ash, & Goodell, 2017)\u200b. Cooke et al. (2017) went on further to identify that medical students did not see their role in treating and preventing childhood obesity and instead placed that responsibility onto parents and schools.

The wolf (Canis lupus) is the most studied large carnivore in the world. After a massive decline and several local extinctions, mostly due to direct persecutions, wolves are now recolonizing many areas of their historical natural range. One of the main monitoring techniques is the howling survey, which is based on the wolves\u2019 tendency to use vocalisations to mark territory ownership in response to howls of unknown individuals. In most cases wolf howling sessions are useful for the localisation of the pack, but they provide only an aural estimation of the chorus size.We tested and present a new bioacoustic approach to estimate chorus size by recording wolves\u2019 replies and visualising choruses through spectrograms and spectral envelopes. To test the methodology, we compared: a) the values detected by visual inspections with the true chorus size to test for accuracy; b) the bioacoustic estimations of a sample of free-ranging wolves\u2019 replies developed by different operators to test for precision of the method; c) the aural field estimation of chorus size of a sample of free-ranging wolves\u2019 replies with the sonogram analysis of the same recordings to test for difference between methods.ResultsVisual inspection of the chorus by spectrogram and spectrum proved to be useful in determining the number of concurrent voices in a wolf chorus. Estimations of chorus size were highly correlated with the number of wolves counted in a pack, and 92\u00a0% of 29 known chorus sizes were recognized by means of bioacoustic analysis. On the basis of spectrographic evidence, it was also possible to identify up to seven concurrent vocalisations in a chorus of nine wolves. Spectral analysis of 37 free ranging wolves\u2019 replies showed a high correlation between the chorus size estimations of the different operators (92.8\u00a0%), but a low correlation with the aural estimation (59.2\u00a0%).ConclusionsWolf howling monitoring technique could be improved by recording wolves\u2019 replies and by using bioacoustic tools such as spectrograms and spectral envelopes to determine the size of the wolf chorus. Compared with other monitoring techniques (i.e., genetic analysis), bioacoustic analysis requires widely available informatic tools (i.e., sound recording set of devices and sound analysis software) and a low budget. Information obtained by means of chorus analysis can also be combined with that provided by other techniques.Moreover, howls can be recorded and stored in audio file format with a good resolution (i.e. in \u201cWave\u201d format), thus representing a useful tool for future listening and investigations, which can be countlessly employed without risks of time deterioration.", "authors": ["D.

The duration of elicited howling increased significantly with group size: howls by single wolves or pairs lasted, on average, 34\u201340\u00a0s, whereas those of five to seven\u00a0wolves (including pups) had an average duration of 67\u201395\u00a0s, with a maximum length of nearly 4\u00a0min.

A wolf howl is a low-frequency vocalization that can be transmitted over long distances and thus it can be used for monitoring. Elicited howling survey is a current method to monitor wolves in different areas all over the world. Elicited howling, however, may be invasive to residential wolf packs and could create possible negative reactions from the human population. Here we show that it is possible to detect wolves by recording spontaneous howling events. We measured the sound pressure level of wolf howls by captive individuals and we further found that elicited howling may be recorded and clearly identified up to a distance of 3 km. We finally conducted a non-invasive acoustic detection of wolves in a free-ranging population. The use of passive sound recorders may provide a powerful non-invasive tool for future wolf monitoring and could help to establish sustainable management plans for this species.", "authors": ["S. M.

Leopold invested his life in observing nature. His keen appreciation for ecological systems became the foundation for his profound land ethic, which stressed taking the long view of humanity's relationship with nature to preserve its integrity, stability, and beauty. Such a perspective is characteristic of the gerontological worldview. Like the environmentalists whom Leopold counseled to \"think like a mountain,\" in gerontology we too take the long view of human life. When we take time to look deeply, we can see both the fragility and the strength of each human life, each tree, each creature, each stream and mountain. And we can discern the fundamental interconnectedness and interdependence in life. In this issue of Generations, we explore research and practice on aging and the environment and discuss elements that bring the two fields together. Making this connection is critical at the present time because of two societal trends: the rapidly growing aging population and mounting concern about environmental sustainability, specifically climate change. John Muir warned that \"when we tug at a single thing in nature, we find it attached to the rest of the world.\" Worsening environmental hazards are \"things that tug\" at human health in later life, including such threats as air pollution, drinking-water contaminants, heavy metals in our bodies- as well as the greatest public health threat to our world, climate change. We offer this issue to alert and inform readers about the critical importance of the environment to an aging society, and to explore how gerontologists, environmental scientists, and older people themselves can come together to find common cause. Why Should Gerontologists Address Environmental Issues? One reason that gerontologists should address environmental issues is straightforward: Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the twenty-first century (Costello et al., 2009), affecting all population groups, including older people. Writing in The Lancet, Richard Horton (2009) described a study of the threats of climate change in which \"[a] systematic review of the evidence showed that the risks from changing patterns of disease, food insecurity, unsafe water and sanitation, damage to human settlements, extreme events, and population growth and migration were far more severe for human health than most observers had understood.\" The researchers found that the threat was not only environmental and economic, but also affected human health and mortality. The recent series of scientific studies conducted by researchers from the United Kingdom and the United States for The Lancet and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (Horton, 2009) makes clear that when greenhouse gases are reduced, health benefits result in both the immediate and the long term. That health dividends are considerable is an emerging and compelling message. One study found that short-lived greenhouse pollutants such as sulphates, organic and black carbon, and ozone are significant risk factors for cardiovascular mortality. Reducing these pollutants- created primarily by combustion by-products from power, transport, and household sectors- will offer an immediate benefit for health (Horton, 2009). Reducing emissions through more walking and cycling and less use of motor vehicles will bring tremendous health benefits. Heart disease and stroke could drop by 10-20 percent, with reductions in breast cancer (12-13 percent), dementia (8 percent), and depression (5 percent) (Haines et al., 2009). Responses of species to warming across the Northern Hemisphere are well documented by changes in the timing of growth stages, especially the earlier onset of spring events, migration, and lengthened growing seasons (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). \u2026", "authors": ["K.

Reports of mountain lions increased during the 1990s, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) does acknowledge the existence of this species within the state. However, State officials continue to insist that the majority of these sightings involve former captive animals or misidentification of other species, rather than a wild population of mountain lions. The growing number of mountain lion sightings in recent years \u2014 by biologists, hunters, and other citizens \u2014 suggests that there may well be a small breeding population of the species in Michigan. History In 1984, while hunting on the Patowachie-Hannaville Indian Reservation fifteen miles west of the town of Escanaba in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a Native American hunter spotted a mountain lion ( Puma concolor) \u2014 also known as cougar or puma \u2014 while trying to spook some deer. The man quickly lifted his rifle and fired, wounding the cat, which responded by leaping ten feet into the air, and then running off with one leg flopping (Zuidema 1999). The hunter discovered bone fragments from the right front paw and proceeded to track the cat in light snow into a bog full of leatherleaf shrubs (Zuidema 1999). He collected the bone fragments and gave them to wildlife officials. Michael Zuidema, a retired Forester from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR), sent the bone samples to a wildlife lab at Colorado State University's College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in Fort Collins, where high resolution electrophoresis determined it was indeed from a mountain lion (Zuidema 1999). The mountain lion was originally part of Michigan's native fauna, at the top of the food chain with the black bear, (Ursus americanus ), the wolf (Canis lupus), and the wolverine (Gulo gulo). By the late 1800s, however, only a few of the felids still survived in remote recesses of the Upper Peninsula (UP) (Zuidema 1999). The last recorded cougar killed in Michigan was in the UP in December of 1906, near the Tahquamenon River, in Luce County (Zuidema 1999). By the early 1900s the species was listed as extirpated in Michigan (Manville 1948). It seems clear, though, that the Tahquamenon cat was not the last of its kind in the UP, or even the Lower Peninsula. Since the 1920s, there has been a steady stream of reports of the big cats, mostly dismissed by DNR officials (Zuidema 2000, pers. comm.). There are several reliable records of people seeing pumas in the late 1930s and early 1940s, including one documented record of a cougar from the Huron Mountains of Marquette County in 1937 (Manville 1948). Credible sightings of the felids also date from the 1960s to the present. From 1962-1992 there were valid reports of cougars from every county in the UP except for Keweenaw (Evers 1994). Many of those reports, though, were not verified by DNR officials (Minzey 2000, pers. comm.). Frequently, people who claim to have spotted a large felid either inform the DNR too long after the a sighting or sign, or the supposed cat turns out to be another large mammal, such as a deer or wolf (Minzey 2000, pers. comm.). In addition, a large number of reported puma sightings are in areas where wolves are known residents (Minzey 2000, pers. comm.). Recent sightings in the Upper Peninsula There is, however, conclusive evidence of mountain lions in Michigan. On Memorial Day in 1998, a puma was photographed on the grounds of Thistledowne, a Bed & Breakfast establishment near the town of Gulliver in southern Schoolcraft County (Hughes 2000, pers. comm.) (Figure1). Three fuzzy photographs through a plate-glass window were taken of the cougar as it stood outside in the yard by the gazebo along the sand dunes. The animal then ran into the woods on the shore of Seul Choix Point, on Lake Michigan (McCarthy 2001, pers. comm.). Two of the photographs show the unmistakable outline of a large felid's lithe body and rounded head. Seul Choix Point is a sandy spit of land in southern Schoolcraft", "authors": ["M.

We also studied how the residents' disability and stage of cognition modified the association between observation year and protein intake (g/body weight kg).\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo cross-sectional samples were collected in 2007 (n\u00a0=\u00a0350) and 2017-8 (n\u00a0=\u00a0476) in long-term care settings. Residents' nutrient intake was determined by a one- or two-day food record. Residents' disability was determined by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) \"personal care\" question and stage of cognition was determined by the CDR \"memory\" item.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no significant difference in energy intake between the observation years. Carbohydrates, total protein, and protein (g/body weight kg) intakes were significantly lower in 2017-8 than in 2007. Fat intake was higher in 2017-8 than in 2007. In 2017-8, the intake of some vitamins and minerals was lower (thiamine, calcium) but some higher (vitamins A, D, C, E) compared to 2007. Residents' disability (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) and observation year (p\u00a0=\u00a00.037) were significantly associated with protein intake (g/body weight kg), but the interaction was not significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.35).

Vespula germanica (Fab.) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) is an invasive social wasp that frequently forages on undepleted food sources, making several flights between the resource and the nest. Previous studies have shown that during this relocating behavior, wasps learn to associate food with a certain site, and can recall this association 1 h later. In this work, we evaluated whether this wasp species is capable of retrieving an established association after 24 h. For this purpose, we trained free flying individuals to collect proteinaceous food from an experimental plate (feeder) located in an experimental array. A total of 150 individuals were allowed 2, 4, or 8 visits. After the training phase, the array was removed and set up again 24 h later, but this time a second baited plate was placed opposite to the first. After 24 h we recorded the rate of wasps that returned to the experimental area and those which collected food from the previously learned feeding station or the nonlearned one. During the testing phase, we observed that a low rate of wasps trained with 2 collecting visits returned to the experimental area (22%), whereas the rate of returning wasps trained with 4 or 8 collecting visits was higher (51% and 41%, respectively). Moreover, wasps trained with 8 feeding visits collected food from the previously learned feeding station at a higher rate than those that did from the nonlearned one. In contrast, wasps trained 2 or 4 times chose both feeding stations at a similar rate. Thus, significantly more wasps returned to the previously learned feeding station after 8 repeated foraging flights but not after only 2 or 4 visits.

In particular, he charts the rise of the specialized food and drink outlet at Pompeii, marked out in the archaeological record by distinctive masonry counters, which in themselves represent a marked growth in capital investment in retail. For Ellis, this is all part of a general Augustan economic upturn (p. 175). However, demographic expansion is also identified as key here (p. 177), and it is not always clear if the increased demand for food and drink outlets is down to a rise in urban living standards, or simply a consequence of increased levels of urbanization, with growing numbers of people reliant on the market to supply their needs. His ultimate conclusion here is that there were not just more shops than ever before in the early empire, but that they were much more specialized ones; it was, he claims, \u2018a period that gave rise to the Roman retail city\u2019 (p. 186). Ellis is surely correct to place retail at the centre of the Roman urban experience, but this does not in itself rely on the taberna, and beyond the development of bars at Pompeii, this specialization is not fully demonstrated, nor are the changes to production that drove a move away from the small-scale urban workshop explored in any detail. The vast majority of tabernae in the archaeological record remain generic in form, and could presumably have been used for a wide variety of functions. Ellis\u2019 third and final \u2018retail revolution\u2019 marks the rise of retail homogenization in the early second century (chapter 7), with increasingly standardized shops with shuttered doorways and entrances on the right-hand side being constructed as part of much larger building complexes, incorporating shops, apartments and public spaces. I would argue that this standardization and ubiquity in fact reflect the flexibility of these units, rather than suggesting any standardization of retail practices; after all, it is often just the footprint of these units that survives, telling us very little about how they were used in antiquity. Ellis\u2019 concluding chapter considers the role of retail in the Roman city (chapter 8), although the focus is primarily on the place of bars in urban life. This discussion is important and interesting in its own right, but to a certain extent reflects the tension inherent throughout this book between the study of food and drink outlets specifically and the retail trade more broadly. There is little in this final chapter about the wider role of retail, about supply chains, about who staffed these shops, about the customers, about their profitability, and so on. There is some internal contradiction here, as earlier in the book Ellis claimed that shops were not particularly lucrative and that they were often staffed by freedmen, but the implications are not discussed further here. If this were indeed the case, then retail was not part of any economic boom per se, nor were shops openly available on the rental market to independent entrepreneurs. In this final analysis, however, retail is explicitly linked to economic growth. The development of food-and-drink outlets in particular reflects increased standards of living, fulfilling more of a want than a need; it is here that we see \u2018cashed-up urbanites\u2019 (p. 245) choosing to spend their money in bars, offering an economic opportunity for retailers. Retail was for a long time neglected in studies of the ancient economy, rejected in favour of long-distance trade and a focus on production, rather than consumption. It is only recently that the retail trade has started to attract the interest that it deserves and Ellis makes an important contribution to this growing body of work. He offers a detailed study of the taberna in the archaeological record, confidently handling a vast amount of data and demonstrating the complexity not only of the world of the taberna, but also of the social, economic and political setting of the urban centres in which they operated.", "authors": ["Ruth M.

These included nine species that were used to make agricultural tools, five species for dyes and mordants, four species for timber, three species for fuelwood, four species for religious ritual use, three species for washing, two species for incense, two species for thatching, two species for fiber (rope and paper), two \u201ccalendar plants\u201d were used to indicate seasons for agricultural purposes, two fish poison plant species, and one species were used as a tobacco substitute. Based on taxonomic insights and from studies elsewhere, we suggested that fiber species were under-reported (c. 14 species were used vs. one species reported used). Even though these plant species are rich and diverse, the use of endemic or near-endemic species was rarely recorded in previous studies. These species included Arenga micrantha (used for starch), Hornstedtia tibetica (fruits), Castanopsis clarkei (edible nuts) and Gnetum pendulum (edible nuts), Ophiorrhiza medogensis (vegetables), Derris scabricaulis (fish poison), Radermachera yunnanensis (agricultural tools), Litsea tibetana (seed oil), Dendrocalamus tibeticus (wine strainers and implements for administering medicine), Zanthoxylum motuoense (spices), Cinnamomum contractum (tobacco substitutes), Morus wittiorum (medicines), and Garcinia nujiangensis (funeral rituals). Despite the absence of roads until 2013 and the impression of \u201cisolation,\u201d Monpa knowledge of plant use reflects three categories of change. Firstly, oral histories of plants used in Bhutan were also encountered by Monpa people after their migration from Bhutan to south-eastern Tibet. Secondly, a \u201cslow change\u201d through centuries of exchange of knowledge (for example of Chinese and Tibetan medical systems), seeds of introduced crops (finger millet (indigenous to Africa), maize (from Meso-America)), and experimentation and use of introduced medicinal plants (such as Datura stramonium , which originates from North America). Thirdly, \u201cfast change\u201d over the past decade. This is reflected in changes in traditional architecture and in rising commercial trade in selected plant resources such as Dendrobium orchid stems and Paris polyphylla rhizomes which are in demand in China\u2019s Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) markets). Conclusions Monpa people in the south-eastern Tibet have detailed knowledge of the diverse plant resources. But that traditional knowledge is now faced with a crisis because of the modern socio-economic change. In addition, Monpa knowledge of plants reflects slower changes in knowledge as well. For example, Monpa ethnomedicine has been influenced by traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicine over a longer period in time. Overall, this study provides a deeper understanding of the Monpa peoples\u2019 knowledge on wild plants, including endemic and near-endemic species whose uses have not been previously recorded. Several of these narrowly distributed species, such as the fish poison Derris scabricaulis , could be the focus of further studies. Some wild edible plants may also have interesting dietary constituents which need in-depth studies. These detailed studies could enable the Monpa people to benefit from the use of their traditional plant-derived culture and therefore support the biodiversity conservation.", "authors": ["Shan Li", "Yuanqin Zhang", "Yongjie Guo", "Lixin Yang", "Yuhua Wang"], "citations": 9, "venue": "Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine", "year": 2020}, "8": {"title": "P300-tracking of changes in information processing / working memory in preclinical alzheimer\u2019s and mild cognitive impairments (MCI)", "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a presently incurable disease with a significant health burden, with a prevalence of 5.8 million Americans as of2019. Prognosis as well as more effective treatment regimens could be greatly augmented by reliable means of diagnosis in the earlier stages of development. Efforts to characterize impairments in memory in pre Clinical AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) range from the domain involved (episodic, semantic, working, perceptual, or visuospatial), to storage (sensory, long-term, short-term, explicit, implicit, autobiographical and morpheus), to memory processing including working memory or information processing (encoding, storage, and retrieval). An emerging area of research aims to determine whether detectable impairments in encoding, storage or retrieval have the ability to serve as hallmarks of pre Clinical Alzheimer\u2019s and early MCI giving both clinicians and patients a window of opportunity to halt or reverse progression to AD via early treatment options. For the identification of event related potential (ERP) markers, the P300 has shown promise as a state-of-the-art new device. While prolonged P300 latency recorded via electroencephalograph\u2019s (EEG) like BrainView NeuralScan is seen in normal aging, individuals with AD exhibit more prolonged P300 latencies and frontal-dominant P300 distribution when compared to normal individuals of the same age. Key questions now remaining include whether identification of these EEG hallmarks identified with the assistance of devices such as the P300 may provide us with an earlier timeframe in the diagnosis, prognosis and early treatment for AD, as well as providing crucial insights into mechanisms of its early pathogenesis. *Correspondence to: Jonathan RT Lakey, PhD, MSM, Department of Surgery, 333 City Blvd West, Suite 1600, Orange, CA 92868, USA, E-mail: jlakey@uci.edu Received: May 29, 2020; Accepted: June 26, 2020; Published: June 29, 2020 SCD are >60 years and b) <30% of individuals with SCD test biomarker positive [29-34]. In 2019 a study inferred that the P300 an event related potential (ERP) marker was able to differentiate with 100% accuracy between individuals with new-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and normal subjects [35]. The study also suggested that the P300 elicited using the task-drive odd-ball paradigm recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) machines like BrainView NeuralScan could be potentially used to detect AD in the pre-clinical stage [35]. In 2019 it was estimated that 5.8 million Americans had AD [36]. In general, normal aging exhibits \u201cdecline in\u201d \u2013 recall, episodic memory, processing speed and divided attention, while implicit memory and recognition remains \u201cstable\u201d with semantic memory, crystallized IQ and emotional reasoning improving till \u224860 years of age [37-39]. Beginning with \u201closs of memory\u201d (inability to encode or retrieve recent memories) individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) subsequently complain of difficulty with attention, planning, semantic memory, and abstract thinking. Further progression of AD results in greater memory loss, language difficulties, failure to recognize close family and friends, emotional instability and finally loss of control over bodily functions [37-39]. The present article will describe the changes in working memory (WM) and information processing in pre-clinical AD and MCI Miranda P (2020) P300-tracking of changes in information processing / working memory in preclinical alzheimer\u2019s and mild cognitive impairments (MCI) J Syst Integr Neurosci, 2020 doi: 10.15761/JSIN.1000233 Volume 7: 2-9 captured via the P300. The benefit of state-of-the art EEG machines like BrainView NeuralScan (Figure 1) is that in addition to ERPbased (i.e. P300) identification of preclinical AD, brain mapping using quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), and source localization using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) imaging to identify Brodmann areas (BA) affected is possible. Thus the clinician can micro-monitor progression and titer treatments using ERPs like the P300 and at the same time be able to identify areas of the cortex that are involved which in turn allows them to anticipate which cortical functions might be compromised in the future. Working memory and Information processing Deficit in episodic memory is a key impairment seen in early AD. Working memory (WM) defined as \u201cthe capacity to hold information that is absent in mind for brief periods of time\u201d [35,36]. The model consists of the central executive that controls and regulates the function of the phonological loop (articulatory loop and acoustic store), the episodic buffer and the visuospatial sketchpad; allocating attention to current relevant tasks and block out irrelevant tasks. In the WM model the three processes in memory formation include: information encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Long-term memories are formed when information is transferred from short-term to permanent episodic representation by rehearsal [35,36]. Early AD memory complaints revolve around encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of information, deficits in the acquisition of new information (encoding) and retention or retrieval deficit in early AD remains equivocal [37-50], P300 and Theories on P300 Neurocognitive functional connectivity markers like the P300 that use EEG/MEG/event related potentials) in combination with resting state or goal-driven oddball paradigms (tasks/attention/visual/auditory/ response inhibition Go/NoGO) to elicit and study brain function are sensitive [35-41,51-57]. They have the potential to demonstrate abnormal diffuse slowing, delay and suppression of responses to sensory and cognitive stimuli, identify pre-clinical AD, in treatment evaluation be it medication (eg.: effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on AD Figure 1. Report summarizing the results of visual and auditory processing, attention, working memory/information processing evaluated using the P300 and resting EEG (eyes open and eyes closed) using BrainView NeuralScan by Medeia Miranda P (2020) P300-tracking of changes in information processing / working memory in preclinical alzheimer\u2019s and mild cognitive impairments (MCI) J Syst Integr Neurosci, 2020 doi: 10.15761/JSIN.1000233 Volume 7: 3-9 patients), neurofeedback or neurotherapy [35-47,51-63]. Among them, the P300 recorded using EEG machines like BrainView NeuralScan by Medeia (Figure 1) captures information processing memory, attention, executive function with the dopamine-mediated P300a playing a key role in frontal working memory (WM) function while medial temporal lobe generated P300b component, is norepinephrine-mediated [48,49]. P3a reflects orientation to a nontarget deviant stimulus, focal attention, engagement of attention, processing novelty executive function [5053,62-65]. Decline in P3a amplitude has been shown to correspond to decreased attention and executive function in mild AD indicative of its potential as a preclinical marker of AD and aiding clinicians in arriving at a more objective diagnosis and treatment titration [50-53,62-65]. Theories on P300 include i) stimulus evaluation hypothesis subsequently refuted [66-68], ii) Sokolov\u2019s context-updating hypothesis environment i.e. updating occurs when relevant stimuli are presented [60,69-71], iii). context-closure hypothesis namely; first consolidation of stimuli is carried out to achieve a meaningful context and when this is followed by background stimuli i.e. the meaningful event is over. closure is initiated [70,72-74]. Other trivia to keep in mind include; P300 latencies and larger amplitudes reflect superior information processing with the converse indicating decline in cognitive function [60,70,74-78]. 60% of P300 morphology observed is individual specific and stable showing little variation over recording sessions/trials and with morphology, reaction times (RTs), 75% of speed and errors positively correlated with age [79-88]. Individual variations in P300 mediated by arousal levels are guided by an individual\u2019s traits, state (natural and biological eg. body temperature, sleep quality, exercise, food intake, drugs) and physiological properties (anatomical features of the corpus callosum or skull thickness) [86-88]. Systematic and meta-analytic reviews on P300 Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the auditory P300 and age based on both a systematic and meta-analytic review of 75 studies (n=2811) [89]. Age-related degenerative effects include increase in P300 latencies and decline in amplitude [90,91]. This coupled with changes in white matter integrity influence executive dysfunction in the elderly [90,92,93]. To compensate for this decline older adults recruit other neural networks mediated in the prefrontal cortices to help meet the task as hand however once a particular threshold is crossed this is no longer possible and decline in cognitive performance can be seen (\u2018CRUNCH\u2019 model) [85,94-108]. In a clinical trial on 103 with mild AD and 101 healthy controls (HC) between 60 and 90 years of age Cecchi et al. evaluated suitable ERP markers of mild AD. P3a amplitude (\u03bcV) differed significantly between healthy controls (HC, n=101) 5.88\u00b10.19 and those with mild AD (n=103) 3.63\u00b10.20** following a distractor (white noise) stimulus. Latency (ms) did not appear to be significantly different between HC 417.3\u00b12.4 and those with AD 419.8\u00b13.0 [70]. Both P3b amplitude (\u03bcV) differed significantly between healthy controls (HC) 6.03\u00b1 0.20 and those with AD 4.42\u00b10.20** following a target (2000 Hz) stimulus as well as latency (ms) HC 396.0\u00b12.8, AD 419.6\u00b13.3* [109]. Pedroso et al. carried out a systematic review of 8 studies (Caravaglios et al., O\u2019Mahony et al., Lai et al., Yamaguchi et al., Golob & Starr, Bennys et al., Juckel et al. and Frodl et al.) that examined the auditory P300 amplitude and latency in AD [110-118].

Looking specifically at Mansfield and snack food, Woolf and armchairs and Elizabeth Bowen and hats and gloves, it explores the ways in which each type of object models a particular way of reading. Pitched against conceptions of the novel as the most apt literary vehicle for ideas and modernism as a highfalutin and inaccessible enterprise, it argues that the modernist short story is a philosophical form which encourages revelatory reading in quotidian contexts. Through examination of the intrinsic interrelation between stories and everyday objects, each fitting ergonomically around the other in terms of their production, consumption and contents, this thesis calls for a reappraisal of the importance of the short fiction genre to the development of modernist aesthetics. It conceives of Katherine Mansfield\u2019s short fiction as a type of literary snack: accessible, quickly consumed and working against restrictive traditions. Examining moments of snacking in Mansfield\u2019s short fiction via Walter Benjamin\u2019s conception of Jetztzeit (from \u2018Theses on the Philosophy of History\u2019, 1940) \u2013 time that is poised, abundant and filled with potential revolutionary energy \u2013 it argues that snacks and stories allow access to the insight enabled by the \u2018presence of the now\u2019. Next, it goes on to consider how the armchair functions in Woolf\u2019s stories as both noun and adjective; a space for reading stories and the wider world, which also encourages a democratising, amateur perspective. Employing Martin Heidegger\u2019s concept of phenomenology as necessitated by a questioning mode of being (as set out in Being and Time, 1927), it suggests both the armchair and story as routes to authentic being. Finally, it examines Bowen\u2019s short fiction, exploring peripheral detail as epitomised by hats and gloves as philosophical expression of her emphasis on the eccentric. Using Jacques Derrida\u2019s notion of the parergon from The Truth in Painting (1987) as a framework for examining Bowen\u2019s aesthetics, it establishes accessory detail in her stories as a rich and anarchic site of meaning which encourages eccentric and creative reading practices.

Three years earlier, the patient received a diagnosis of T2DM based on Diabetes Canada criteria.1 At the time of diagnosis, he had intermittent hyperglycemia, a high 2-hour glucose reading on his oral glucose tolerance test (20.5 [normal < 11.1] mmol/L) and a negative GAD65 antibody level (< 3.0 [normal < 5.0] U/mL). His high body mass index (31.9, > 97th percentile), the presence of acanthosis nigricans and an elevated fasting insulin level (277 [normal 35\u2013140] pmol/L), although not diagnostic, were supportive of a diagnosis of T2DM. The patient began dietary and lifestyle interventions. Medical therapy escalated since diagnosis to include metformin and insulin owing to suboptimal glycemic control. A timeline of events is shown in Figure 1. The patient completed diabetes self-management education that included information on nutrition, insulin, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, management during an intercurrent illness and ketone management according to standard-of-care clinical practice guidelines. Despite this, his hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) averaged 9%. His diabetes self-management was characterized by fingerstick glucose monitoring 0\u20132 times daily, frequent insulin omission and suboptimal adherence with metformin. His GAD65 antibody level remained negative. He had had no episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hypoglycemia. Two months before presentation, the patient\u2019s primary care provider prescribed canagliflozin (a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 [SGLT-2] inhibitor) starting at 100 mg/d and titrated to 300 mg/d. His prescribed therapy also included metformin (1500 mg at bedtime), insulin glargine (30 units at bedtime) and insulin lispro (1 unit for 3 g of carbohydrate with meals and snacks). At the time our patient presented to hospital he reported that 5 days earlier, on day 1 of his illness, he had decreased his prandial insulin on his own volition because of \u201clow\u201d blood glucose (about 8 mmol/L). He was fearful of hypoglycemia because of decreased intake and vomiting, which led him to stop taking his insulin and metformin; he continued to take canagliflozin. He had not monitored blood glucose or ketones for the 5 days before his presentation to hospital, nor used the telephone assistance service provided by the diabetes centre. On initial assessment, the patient had the following vital signs: heart rate of 130 beats/min, blood pressure of 146/92 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min with Kussmaul respiration, oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, body temperature of 36.7\u00b0C and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. He was pale, with sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes and abdominal tenderness with no features of peritonitis. The patient had a serum glucose level of 17.4 (normal 3.3\u2013 11.0) mmol/L.

If the parents do not have to money to send their children to a program that requires some form of payment, the parents turn to free afterschool programs that are based at the school site. These programs are usually academic-based and provide help with homework, as well as other enrichment activities. Bringing community members into these programs allows students to have more opportunities that help to expand their thinking. Fresh faces and different viewpoints allow the students to become well-rounded individuals, without costing the parents any money. The community can help students receive the most out of their afterschool experience besides just homework help and eating snack. MORE THAN JUST HOMEWORK HELP AND SNACK 4 Meeting MLOs for Liberal Studies B.A. When I first started my undergrad career at California State University, Monterey Bay, I had not fully committed to the Liberal Studies department. I was unsure what I wanted to do with my time in Monterey, and it was not until I committed to Liberal Studies major that I rekindled my love for wanting to become an elementary school teacher. The professors that I encountered on my journey through the Liberal Studies major and Human Development minor have helped me grow as a future educator and as the woman that I am today. The first service learning class that I took, Intro To Public Education (LS 298) with Annette LeTourneau, helped to kick start my love for being in the classroom and the steps towards becoming a developing educator. Before taking this class, I did not know how many different things were involved and implemented into classrooms. I simply thought that I would walk into the class and hope that everything worked out. Innovative Approach to Schooling (LS 383), with Tessa Mauro, also opened my eyes to all of the types of schooling that there are in the world. I believe in order to be a successful educator, a person needs to be willing to realize that there is more than meets the eye. Both of these classes and professors guided me towards meeting the Major Learning Outcome #1: Developing Educator. Becoming a teacher, it is important to realize that there will be diversity in the classroom, especially in California classrooms. Because of this, it is important to successfully meet the Major Learning Outcome #2: Diversity and Multicultural Scholar. Dr. Antonio Gallardo allowed me to grow in his class, Diversity in Educational Settings (LS 391). The class was a safe place where tough discussions about diversity and multiculturalism were able to happen. Multicultural Literature for Children and Young Adults (LS 394) taught me how to bring multicultural books and ideas into the classroom so that all the students feel like they are represented one way or MORE THAN JUST HOMEWORK HELP AND SNACK 5 another. It is critical that students feel like they are important and matter, even if they are different from the majority of the class and population. Not one specific course in the Liberal Studies department focuses on the Major Learning Outcome #3: Innovative Technology Practitioner, but I was able to meet this outcome with the help of Dr. Rob Weisskirch and the Human Development classes I have taken. Writing papers, collecting data and results, researching different topics are just some of the components that helped me to fulfill this outcome. I had to learn how to use different types of technology and resources in order to succeed in these courses. In order to be a successful teacher in the future, I have to be willing to learn and stay up to date with technology practices as they continue to change over time. The courses, Social Foundations of Multicultural Education (LS 398) and Teaching for Social Change (LS380), have taught me what it means to be a Social Justice Collaborator and fulfilling Major Learning Outcome #4. There are multiple injustices in education that students and teachers face on a daily basis. Participating in discussions and service learning activities through these courses have allowed me to be creative with finding ways to fix or cope with these injustices. I plan to take what I have learned and put these practices into place when I have a classroom of my own in the near future. In order to successfully pass the two tests necessary to become a teacher, I had to meet Major Learning Outcome #5: Subject Matter Generalist. Intro to Earth Sciences (GEOL 210), Social and Political History of California (SBS 386), and Nature of Language & Language Acquisition (LING 392) are just some of the classes that I took in the past four years have helped me in passing the CBEST and CSET. These classes, along with others, have challenged me in MORE THAN JUST HOMEWORK HELP AND SNACK 6 attaining knowledge in various subject areas that I need to know on my journey of becoming an elementary school teacher. My final capstone project and essay, is the missing puzzle piece for successfully completely all of the Liberal Studies MLOs that I need in order to graduate. On my path to becoming an educator and bringing the community into an afterschool program, I have become a developing educator, diversity and multicultural scholar, innovative technology practitioner, social justice collaborator and finally a subject matter generalist. In order to successfully complete by project and paper, I needed to reflect on all of these MLOs and let them guide me toward the end of my undergrad career. These MLOs have made it possible for me to research and focus on the important aspects of bringing the community into after school programs in the area. Introduction Parents who are not able to pick up their children right after school or need extra help with homework have the option to send their students to after school programs. There are multiple after school programs those children of different age ranges can choose to attend. Numerous after school programs focus on helping the students with the homework, while others focus on activities that are not specifically school or homework based. Not all of the after school programs that are available are free to students; there are a few that parents have to pay monthly for in order for the students to attend. The programs for which parents have to pay typically offer different activities in which the children can participate because the program has money that is available to use as well as the necessary staff members to help facilitate those activities. Not all parents have the ability to pay for their students to attend these types of programs though. Because of this, their students attend the free after school programs. These programs are still MORE THAN JUST HOMEWORK HELP AND SNACK 7 great programs for the students, but many of the programs might not be able to incorporate outside activities depending on the amount of staff and funding that is available at the time. Families that do not have the means to pay for after school programs and activities should be able to feel confident about their decision on the free program their student attends. Working at the After School Academy, ASA, at Del Rey Woods Elementary School in Seaside, this topic has become extremely important to me. This is a grant-based program that receives its money based on the amount of students that attend on a daily basis. The students in ASA are primarily Hispanic or Latino and come from lower income families. The program provides all the students with a free snack after school, and then helps with their homework. A majority of the students are not able to get homework help from their parents when they go home, so it is important that the staff members are able to provide this help to all of the students that attend the program. After the students finish their homework, ASA encourages them to read for at least 30 minutes before they can go to recess and play. This simple task can be difficult to a majority of the students because they are not interested in reading and do not have the attention span to sit in their desk any longer than they already have. Because of this, we are constantly trying to refocus the students and keep them interested and engaged in the task they have to complete.

The Sun rises early, and daylight lasts long into the evening hours. Perhaps it's the lack of bells to define our schedules, or maybe it's metabolic--but our perception of time is very different in June, July, and August. It's not that teachers can't find plenty to do--just catching up on all the chores we put aside during the school year could fill a day or two. But how about using those extra daylight hours for something inspirational? Morning to night, there's something to refresh your spirit and renew your professional skills in NSTA Recommends (see \"On the web\"). In this article, Recommends reviewers share their summer reading suggestions for teachers! The morning bell Wake up with The Robin Makes a Laughing Sound by Sallie Wolf (2010). It's the perfect bedside companion when the chatter of that red-breasted American thrush starts early in the morning. This little book is the perfect journal model: The author observes, sketches, researches, and writes poetry about birds. Whether you choose to spend the rest of your day bird-watching or not, you won't be able to avoid starting your own journal. Wolf inspires the sort of self-reflective observations that characterize scientists, and shares a lot of factual--and fanciful--information about birds. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] For many folks, the day begins best with a walk. If you're a city dweller, Stories in Stone (Williams 2009) provides the ideal preparation for your journey past buildings and human structures. From Salem limestone--the Mississippian rock that forms the backbone of many of the buildings in Chicago--to the marble used by Michelangelo and other sculptors, this book describes the science, history, and human-interest stories embedded in these structures. Look up: Even the slate roof above your head has a story of its own, which David Williams tells in a narrative you just can't put down. Another must-read for anyone who walks or journals during the summer is one of this year's NSTA/ Children's Book Council (CBC) Outstanding Science Trade Books for Students K--12: Ubiquitous by Joyce Sidman (2010). This big book of poetry gives attention to those organisms we often step on or over--or simply ignore--when we're busy. Ants, geckoes, grass, and lichens are all honored in lyric lines, and then described in exacting science. This book will not only enrich your summer walks and inspire your journal observations, but will also provide you with memorable excerpts to share with students in the fall. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Coffee break By the time you return from your walk, you might be ready for a cup of coffee and a snack. Two new student-targeted books from NSTA Press offer the sort of short mental challenges that fascinate teachers, too--and you can \"dog-ear\" your favorites to share with students in the fall. Recommends reviewer Thomas Brown suggests Earth Science Puzzles by Kim Kastens and Margie Turrin (2010). The authors use authentic data that focus on the essential concepts studied in Earth science classes. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] There's also Yet More Everyday Science Mysteries (Konicek-Moran 2011). In the previous edition--Even More Everyday Science Mysteries--Richard Konicek-Moran (2010) dedicates an entire chapter to the pressing question, \"Do we really get more sunlight from daylight savings time?\" Feel the caffeine buzz?

Although the pathophysiology is unclear, the concomitant presence of transfusion related iron overload, insulin resistance, and beta cell destruction are thought to contribute in the development of DM in this population (Cooksey et al, 2004). \n \nThe oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and serum hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels are commonly used screening tools for diabetes, and have been shown to be valid in individuals with obesity amd family history of diabetes. However, the utility of HbA1c measurement is limited in thalassemia since both hemoglobinopathies and transfusions are known to interfere with HbA1C analysis. The results may be falsely increased or decreased depending on the proximity to transfusion, shortened erythrocyte lifespan and the assay used (Bry et al, 2001; Spencer et al, 2011; Sacks, 2003). Given the above limitations, OGTT has been proposed as the recommended screening method for glucose abnormalities in thalassaemia. However, the OGTT procedure requires patients to fast, is cumbersome and time consuming. \n \nContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems is a new technology that measures glucose concentrations in a continuous fashion, with the use of a sensor that is placed subcutaneously. CGM provides information on glucose excursion in relationship to meals and daily activities, and hence, has added a vital dimension in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to hyperglycemia and management of subjects with diabetes or abnormal OGTT and HbA1c results. In this paper, we set out to evaluate the utility of CGM in subjects with TM, given the limitations of HbA1C and OGTT in this population. The study also documents elevated HbA1C results using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in TM regardless of glycemia. \n \nThe Weill Cornell Medical College standard of care for patients with TM involves yearly screening for DM via OGTT. We invited all adults with TM who presented for their annual OGTT to wear a CGM sensor and have HbA1C measured as part of a larger study that examined relationship between CGM and OGTT results. Five subjects agreed to partake in wearing sensors and twelve had HbA1C measurements. \n \nAll underwent OGTT per protocol. CGM was performed using the Medtronic I Pro 3 day blinded glucose sensor. The sensor was inserted per manufacturer\u2019s recommendations into the subcutaneous tissue compartment of the abdomen. The subjects were instructed to wear the sensor at all times for 72 hours. The subjects were additionally asked to check finger stick glucose (FSG) levels using a glucometer at least four times a day for calibration and comparison purposes. They were asked to keep a detailed log of meals and snacks, exercise, and any medication use. Three days later, the subjects returned for sensor removal, at which time the data was analyzed using version 1.2a of the Medtronic Solutions software. HbA1C was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), normal range: 4 to 6%. All 12 subjects had elevated HbA1c with no clear correlation to the results of their OGTT. Mean HbA1C results were 7.4 % in 3 patients with normal glucose tolerance, 7.33% in 3 patients with pre-diabetes, and 8.16% in 6 patients with DM. \n \nOf the five subjects who underwent CGM, three (#1, 2 and 3) met the criteria for DM based on the two hour glucose value on OGTT above 11.0 mmol/L (Table I). Two of the five subjects (#4 and 5) had normal glucose tolerance (Table I). The FSG which showed normal pre and post meal glucose readings, including in those who had an abnormal OGTT. Complete CGMS data were retrieved and downloaded for all the subjects. Results were normal in all cases. None of the subjects showed the degree of glucose variability seen during OGTT, despite reporting equal and at times greater carbohydrate intake per meal than the glucose load during OGTT. Figure 1 shows the discrepancy between the OGTT and CGM data for the three subjects with DM on OGTT. \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \nDiscrepancy between OGTT results (on the left) and their corresponding CGM (on the right). OGTT results reveal glucose concentrations above 11.0 mmol/L (200 mg/dl) at 120min, which is consistent with DM. In contrast, all glucose values by CGM are within ... \n \n \n \n \n \nTable I \n \nSubjects characteristics with discrepancies between OGTT and CMS, and their HbA1C, OGTT and CGMS results. \n \n \n \nTransfusion dependent TM and DM have a unique and incompletely understood relationship. Similar to other transfusion dependent diseases, the risk of iron overload remains substantial despite improved methods of chelation, resulting in a high prevalence of DM in this population (Vogiatzi et al, 2009; Cooksey et al, 2004). Multiple large scale studies have demonstrated that patients with type 2 DM are at an increased risk for cardiovascular complications, with post-prandial hyperglycemia being a significant risk factor (King et al, 1999; Nathan et al, 2005; Hanefeld et al, 1996; Cengiz, 2009; Blake et al, 2004). Although the significance of similar carbohydrate abnormalities in the aging TM population is unclear at this time, it is reasonable to assume that they are predisposed to the same long term complications, morbidity, and mortality, making accurate and timely diagnosis of DM critical. The onset of hyperglycemia in patients with TM can be insidious and silent. Patients may go through extended periods of impaired glucose tolerance and variable degrees of glycemic excursions. The additional inflammatory stimulus caused by iron deposition, coupled with hyperglycemia, leads to the potential for significant micro and macro vascular complications (Cooksey et al, 2004). \n \nCurrent ADA guidelines recommend screening \u201cat risk populations\u201d with either fasting glucose and insulin levels, random HbA1c levels, or a formal oral glucose tolerance test. These screens impose a burden on patients with TM who are already coming in regularly for transfusions. Glucose and insulin levels require the patients to fast, while the OGTT is invasive and time consuming. Furthermore, the use of HbA1c as a screening tool for DM or assessment of glycemic control is inappropriate in TM. Transfusions may contain hemoglobin molecules exposed to glucose concentrations that are different from those of the transfusion recipient. Data from old literature suggests that high concentration of glucose in the RBC storage medium promotes glycation of the packed RBC and raises HbA1c values in the transfused patients. These findings were not confirmed in recent studies using current blood bank procedures. Moreover, they indicate that transfusions reduce the HbA1c concentration in diabetic patients due to dilution (Spencer et al, 2011). Hemoglobinopathies including thalassemia syndromes, factors that impact red blood cell survival and age, uremia, hyperbilirubinemia, and iron deficiency may all alter HbA1c test results (Herman et al, 2012). Racial and ethnic differences, genetic variation in hemoglobin glycation and assay methodology may also influence the results (Herman et al, 2012). Specific to this report, HPLC is widely used and, in general, is considered superior to immunoassays. However, hemoglobin variants may create an abnormal peak very close to the HbA1C peak, which interferes with HbA1C reading leading to spurious results. In such case, a visual inspection of the HPLC chromatogram may give valuable information regarding hemoglobin variants (Bry et al, 2001), but this is not an established procedure in commercial laboratories. The persistently elevated HbA1C values by HPLC in TM may result in unnecessary and potential life threatening medical interventions. \n \nCGM is a powerful tool to assess diabetes control and the effect of medical management. CGM gives a detailed recording of glucose excursions under daily activities. All three patients who were found to be diabetic by OGTT had normoglycemia by CGM, which is an unexpected finding. We acknowledge the limitations related to small sample size. We can also offer limited insight as to the mechanism. OGTT entails the ingestion of a large bolus of simple sugar. In contrast during CGM, subjects consume a variety of simple and complex carbohydrates, which may evoke different response of gut mediated hormones. Studies evaluating alpha and beta cell reserve and function in Thalaessemia suggest that the effect of iron deposition and inflammation on the pancreatic islets may result in both alpha and beta cell damage (De Sanctis et al, 1985). This type of injury can lead to disturbed insulin and glucagon release from islets, and may contribute to our findings. \n \nOur preliminary report highlights the potential that OGTT results can be erroneous in this population, and that CGM may be more accurate for patients to define their degree of glucose control. Large scale studies may shed light on the role of CGM in TM.", "authors": ["A. Choudhary", "P. Giardina", "Z. Antal", "M.

Painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) have been extremely well-studied over the last two centuries, and their mating system has been described as female choice based on male courtship display. The present study arises from observation that males seemingly have more protracted and serrated anterior marginal scutes than females. We hypothesized that the anterior carapace is sexually dimorphic, and that this morphology is a weapon used by males in coercive mating. We quantified anterior carapacial morphology using geometric morphometric analysis of digital photographs, drawing on samples of painted turtles from North American museum collections and our field site in Algonquin Provincial Park. We found that the anterior carapace of males had a significantly more serrated and projected shape compared to females, consistent with the sexual weapon hypothesis. Additionally, anterior carapacial shape was more strongly related to body size in males. Behavioural field observations strongly suggest that males use this morphology as a weapon to harm females during reproduction. The present study complements and strengthens the recent hypothesis that male painted turtles engage in coercion as an alternative reproductive tactic, questioning the long-understood paradigm of exclusive female choice in this well-studied species. Our study invites new avenues of research on the evolution of female harm in a system with extreme selection on female longevity and for which operational sex ratios vary among populations.

This is explored by examining instances of sexual violence by Pakistani soldiers and their local Bengali collaborators. The prevalence of these discourses in colonial documents about the Bengali Muslims underscores the role of history, the politics of identity and in the process, establishes its link with the rapes of Bangladeshi women and men. Through this, the relationship between sexual violence and historical contexts is highlighted. I locate the accounts of male violations by the West Pakistani army within the historical and colonial discourses relating to the construction of the Bengali Muslim and its intertextual, contemporary citational references in photographs and interviews. I draw on Judith Butler's and Marilyn Strathern's work on gendering and performativity to address the citational role of various practices of discourses of gender and race within colonial documents and its application in a newer context of colonization and sexual violence of women and men during wars. The role of photographs and image-making is intrinsic to these practices. The open semiotic of the photographs allows an exploration of the territorial identities within these images and leads to traces of the silence relating to male violations.

Words edited by J. Michael Lennon Taschen, 2012. 276pp. Cloth $69.99 In 1973, Norman Mailer published Marilyn, a biographical profile meant to be a twenty-thousand word piece, but which Mailer expanded to over one-hundred-thousand words after becoming deeply fascinated with Monroe during the writing process. The book, a bestseller that was released to a series of rave reviews, also featured a collection of pictures of Marilyn taken by a number of notable photographers, including Eve Arnold, Milton Greene, George Barris, and Bert Stern. Marilyn Monroe, an edited re-issue of Marilyn, might seem on the surface to be a pared down version of this initial publication, as it features an abridged version of Mailer's previous book (J. Michael Lennon, who edited Mailer's text, notes that he cut approximately twenty-thousand words from the earlier work) and includes only those photos shot by Stern in his now famous 1962 sitting with Monroe. The effect, however, is quite the opposite, with the final result invoking the sense that one is holding an enhanced rather than abbreviated version of the original. Such an effect largely occurs as a result of the ways in which Mailer's text amplifies the narrative suggested by Stern's photos. In his introduction to this new edition, Larry Schiller (who conceived the idea for the reissue), claims that Stern's are now the \"only\" photographs that can illuminate Mailer's text (19). While this may be overstating the case to some degree, the expansive collection of Stern's photographs does serve to complement Mailer's text in a unique way, achieving a unified effect that a varied collection of pictures by different photographers with different visions in different locations simply cannot match. Moreover, Stern's photos present an image of Marilyn seemingly more consistent with that fashioned by Mailer. That is, while many of Eve Arnold and Milton Green's photos in the original 1973 publication depict a more youthful and buoyant Marilyn, Stern's offer us something else--an older and more subdued Marilyn, beginning to show her age and signs of stress that the un-retouched photos are unable to hide. Likewise, while the chronological structure of Mailer's book suggests that he will trace Marilyn's gradual decline, Mailer's Marilyn always already seems on the verge of implosion--vulnerable, insecure, and struggling. In this way, the image of Marilyn that comes through in Stern's photographs seems to invoke that sense of fragile poise masking an inner turbulence that Mailer's text also suggests. This symbiotic relationship between Mailer's text and Stern's photographs also has much to do with each man's mission to find the essence of Marilyn, and their respective abilities to capture the complexity and nuance of character that often went overlooked during her lifetime. At the center of Mailer's work, specifically, is an obsession with the mystery surrounding Marilyn, from the strange coincidences that \"spring underfoot like toadstools\" throughout the duration of her life to the constant string of contradictions that define her personality (50). Part of this fascination likely arises from the various ways in which aspects of Mailer and Marilyn's lives overlapped. Like Marilyn, Mailer struggled with a controversial public image that threatened to overshadow his craft and at times led to misunderstandings and reductive assumptions about his personal character. It was, in fact, an awareness of this potential connection that led Larry Schiller to handpick Mailer to pen the original profile of Marilyn forty years ago, his rationale being that \"if you could get a writer who has been run over by a lot of trucks, like Marilyn was, and found a way to survive each time, like Marilyn did, it might reveal the key to this deeply mysterious woman\" (16). Yet as Mailer himself notes in his biography, the problem was not just that the \"real\" Marilyn became overshadowed by the public's perception of her, but that, perhaps, there never was a real Marilyn to begin with. \u2026", "authors": ["M.

This presentation reviews the history and management of the insomnia she suffered. Materials and methods Source materials include police and toxicology reports on her death, prescriptions for sleeping drugs filled in the last few months of her life, photographs of her home, filmed or direct accounts from verified witnesses, and Donald Spoto\u2019s 1993 biography. Results MM valued nocturnal sleep to help her look good at work, but developed insomnia during her rise to fame in the context of stage fright. She might have presented jet lag following a flight from Japan, and started using barbiturates due to their easy availability. She became interested in psychoanalysis as a way of self-knowledge and acting improvement. Her psychiatrists treated her with Freudian psychoanalysis and an intensive use of drugs. Her last psychiatrist mostly dealt with psychoanalysis and had a general practitioner to prescribe her drugs. During the last few months of MM\u2019s life she was prescribed a dozen different psychoactive drugs, mostly barbiturates, but also other hypnotic drugs and amphetamines. The major issues regarding her death include the time of death, the position of the body and the sincerity of the witnesses. Blood/ liver samples tested for pentobarbital and chloral hydrate showed lethal concentrations of both. Disturbingly enough, her doctor claimed he only prescribed pentobarbital and never chloral hydrate, which is not true. Drugs complicated the course of MM\u2019s insomnia and had a negative effect on her general health and behaviour, a situation seemingly ignored by the two different psychiatric diagnoses given to her by both doctors (\u201caddictive paranoid borderline personality\u201d, and \u201cmanic-depressive or bipolar personality\u201d). Barbiturates had been available for several decades at the time, and the issues of tolerance, dependency and accidental overdose had to be well known to them. On the other hand, MM thought she exercised a reasonable control on her drug intake, which along with a lack of a real medical control and the presence of spurious interests set the conditions for the advent of a grim outcome. Conclusion The treatment based on Freudian psychoanalysis and drugs failed to improve MM\u2019s condition and arguably worsened it. The very drugs prescribed to her to combat insomnia would eventually cause her death.", "authors": ["M.

Discussing the iconic photo of the burned and naked Vietnamese girl fleeing a U.S. napalm attack in On Photography (1977), Susan Sontag observed that \"images anaesthetize\" and create a confusion about reality that is \"analgesic morally as well as ... sensorially stimulating,\" suggesting the failure of viewers to feel properly, to experience the bodily pain often represented in the photograph. (2) Roland Barthes, writing about an exhibition of photographs of oppression during the Guatemalan revolution, finds the problem is that \"none of these photographs, all too skillful, touches us\"; \"someone has shuddered for us,\" making contact and feeling in our stead. (3) Likening atrocity photographs to pornography, which conversely involves too much feeling, suggests a similarly inapt bodily response. Our desirous consumption and circulation of atrocity images, as Sontag writes about the photographs of Abu Ghraib, is marked by the tropes of pornographic culture. (4) Indeed, in Regarding the Pain of Others (2003) Sontag holds that \"All images that display the violation of an attractive body are, to a certain degree, pornographic.\" (5) That our encounter with photographs of bodily violation may be unconsciously sexual is suggested by the appearance of shock photos on porn websites. If bodily feeling is the key connection between the anesthetic and pornographic effects of atrocity photographs, it is pivotal that the motif of iconic atrocity photographs is the assaulted body. John Taylor notes that \"bodies appear as a matter of routine in gruesome stories from overseas,\" and Barbie Zelizer's research uncovers how during catastrophes and conflicts more photographs appear in newspapers--photos that are larger and likely to show more of the body.6 The term \"pornography\" itself describes bodies in photographs and our relation to them, although, as with pornography itself, the connection is one of symbiotic supply and demand--not simple cause and effect. Sontag powerfully indicates and indicts a cultural context that remains mostly unconscious. In J.G. Ballard's postmodern dystopia of spectacle culture at its emergence, The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), napalm photographs from Vietnam appear on billboards alongside pictures of Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, exhibitions are held of war wounds, and images have the effect of \"sanctioning everything.\" William S. Burroughs comments in the novel's preface, \"Sexual arousal results from the repetition and impact of image.\"7 Photographs--of the image world (of the imaginary)--grab attention and appeal to our visual pleasure. As consumers, our viewpoint is disembodied--yet, as Barthes writes, the photograph has an embodied, haptic relationship to its referent. (8) The act of viewing photographs of any subject matter is an embodied experience, although rarely is that brought into the frame. Psychological research shows that \"pictures evoke emotions,\" that we are more likely to feel empathy for depictions of single bodies, and that we tend to mirror the affect represented \"in emotional contagion\"--a \"primitive, automatic\" response. (9) In Regarding the Pain of Others, Sontag is more skeptical about the power of photographs to make us feel connected or touched- -saying, ultimately, we cannot imagine other people's pain through photographs. The new technologies of war, visual pleasure, and atrocity exist in ever more addictive and dependent proximity: \"Newer technology provides a nonstop feed: as many images of disaster and atrocity as we can make time to look at.\" (10) The cell phones and other small digital cameras with which the Abu Ghraib photographs were taken and disseminated via the internet threatens to make us forget the body of the photograph and our propinquity to those in the photograph, and to make capturing and sharing subjects all too virtual. \u2026", "authors": ["Jay Prosser"], "citations": 1, "venue": "", "year": 2011}, "8": {"title": "Cyber Child Pornography Law and Technology Problems in Its Law Enforcement", "abstract": "Rapid grow of internet users as a result of widely open access significantly contributes to increasing criminal cases particularly child pornography.

Not wanting to deny the structural domination and day-to-day violence that most women experience, many feminists are equally preoccupied with acknowledging women\u2019s agency and recognizing their resistance. The feminist movement against domestic violence and sexual abuse, for example, has challenged the image of the passive battered woman. Speaking not of \u201cvictims\u201d but of \u201csurvivors,\u201d it has shifted attention to the multitude of ways in which women resist both male violence and its social legitimation (see Mahoney 1994; Schneider 2000, 74\u201386). It has thereby addressed problematic categories such as individual agency and argued for more historically grounded approaches that reflect how, in the process of responding to external social constraints, agency is in fact constructed by these very constraints (see Scott 1990). As such, the movement has helped feminism to disturb the paradigm of \u201cwoman as victim\u201d and of individualistic heroic action. The women\u2019s breast cancer movement is characterized by similar attempts to assess the patient\u2019s seemingly passive response to her illness.

It has affected each of us personally and professionally, as data from our six-month follow-up survey reveal: 45% of respondents reported knowing a friend, family member, or colleague who contracted COVID-19, 15% of respondents reported knowing someone who died of COVID-19, and 2% of respondents reported that they had contracted COVID-19 themselves. The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed our home and work lives in ways thought unimaginable scant months ago. It has transformed most of the practices of psychology. Psychology has transformed from in-office practice into a telepsychology-based profession. Its impact on our collective psyche will be felt for many years. We will continue to address the medium-term and longterm effects of COVID-19 for many years. COVID-19 has transformed from an acute problem (though it must still mostly be addressed as such) to a chronic one. Its effects will not go away, even after an effective vaccine has been developed. It behooves us to begin planning for what comes next. How do we effectively socialize children and adolescents when inperson contact is limited? How do we better mitigate the effects of enforced isolation on people with mental illness? In a society riven by political discord, how do we ensure that the voice of science is heard? As perverse as it may sound, most of us have experienced some positive effects of the virus-forced changes in our behavior. Unnecessary consumer consumption has been curbed. Indices of environmental quality are improving in many areas. A new focus on family togetherness and the value of interpersonal relationships has emerged. I, for one, will not miss the handshake as a socially obligated form of greeting, nor do I plan on boarding an airplane without a mask\u2014regardless of the availability of a vaccine. But the negative effects of the pandemic are staggering. The popular press reports that calls to national suicide hotlines are up. Reports of quasi-scientific national surveys of mental well-being suggest that as many as half of those surveyed are experiencing either negative psychological effects or the emergence of obvious mental symptoms as a result of the pandemic. The pandemic, combined with an attendant economic recession and a season filled with natural disasters likely accelerated by climate change (wildfires in the western US, hurricanes and flooding in the eastern US), have created a perfect storm of psychological stressors with which many have difficulty coping. More systematic investigations suggest an increase in adverse psychological responses, particularly among young adults, first responders, and some ethnic minorities. A Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, looking at data collected relatively early in the pandemic in June 2020, found substantial increases in anxiety and depression symptoms, and suicidal ideation rates double those observed in 2018 (Czeisler et al., 2020). We lead off this issue with the results of our recently completed second survey of psychologists\u2019 practices during the pandemic. In March 2020, we completed the first national survey of psychologists\u2019 practices at the beginning of the pandemic (Sammons, VandenBos&Martin, 2020a). That survey, initiated only one week after the United States had declared a public health emergency, was quickly followed by several other national surveys. In spite of differences in methodology, results of these surveys were strikingly similar: Psychologists had rapidly and overwhelmingly switched to telepsychology service provision, and they felt largely comfortable in their ability to do so. Early in the pandemic, practice caseloads had dropped for the majority of providers. Our earlier survey also indirectly suggested that patients had moderate levels of discomfort associated with the use of telepsychology. Our follow-up survey, almost six months later, found that the shift to telepsychology appears to have concretized (Sammons, VandenBos,Martin& Elchert, 2020b).Many providers anticipate that this will be a significant part of their service provision after a vaccine is available and the pandemic ends.

Residents are required to learn and apply volumes of complex information and to become proficient in clinical service delivery to meet the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competency requirements in psychiatry [1]. The information gleaned from didactic education, supervision, reading, observation, practicing, collaborative communication, and other education modalities facilitates building and refining a skillset that is a prerequisite for independent practice [2]. Unfortunately, the growing body of professional resources, including medical literature, makes it challenging, at best, to produce well-rounded physician/ scholars in an increasingly complex society. The psychiatry Residency Training Director is challenged with the task of crafting a training experience that treats education requirements equitably. She prioritizes training opportunities and refines the didactics curriculum and other educational modalities to offer residents a quality and balanced time-limited training experience that meets ACGME standards. This is an onerous task given the growing volume of available educational resources, clinical need, and related opportunities. Consequently, some sectors of required psychiatric education that may merit additional attention may be overlooked [1]. One such area involves training psychiatric residents to function as advocates for the profession and their patients. Residents can refine their communication skills by reaching out to and educating the public about mental health\u2014including emotional wellness, the mental health system, psychiatric assessment and treatment, destigmatizing mental illness, and access to care\u2014in greater detail than what is available in medical office brochures and public service announcements. One way to accomplish this involves empowering psychiatry residents to use critical thinking skills to identify lowcost, high-quality mental health educational materials that may appeal to the public. This requires residents to use a dispassionate, evidence-informed, and systematic approach to examining publicly accessible mental health resources. Though the Internet offers access to various forms of media, an Internet audio podcast program\u2014an episodic series of serial recordings that are accessible by downloading their digital files\u2014was used for the project because the recordings can be listened to on many types of electronic devices (computers, smartphones, tablets, MP3 players, automobile stereos, compact disk players, etc.), accessed in many settings, listened to while multitasking and replayed, or in some cases bookmarked, so that the user will be able to review specific segments if desired. Additionally, each podcast recording does not have to be consumed in one sitting. Residents were instructed to listen to several episodes of The Mind Deconstructed Podcast: Mental Health and Wellness with Dr. Kaz and George [3]. The Minnesotabased mental health education program is hosted by siblings Kaz Nelson, M.D., a psychiatrist and psychiatry Residency Training Director, and her brother, George, an attorney who works in child welfare. Their mission is to examine topics in psychiatry, including violence, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and mental health maintenance, in a manner that is user-friendly for non-healthcare professionals. Residents used set descriptors while explaining their impressions to their colleagues. The categories included accuracy of the information (evidence-informed), ease of comprehension (organized), language (absence of jargon), presentation style (approachable), length of recordings, and value of information for laypersons (Table 1). Although the free podcast was easily accessed and had good sound quality, these criteria also merit consideration (Table 1).

Williams eds., forthcoming 2021), asks into the likely implications of the Trump Presidency for the future sustainability of constitutional norms in the United States. It observes that what counts as a persuasive answer to that question turns primarily on why politicians\u2019 respect for constitutional norms has been declining, and it argues that President Donald Trump is more of an effect (and a symptom) than a cause of the decline. Specifically, he is more of an effect than a cause of larger racial and cultural changes in American society that are causing Republican voters and politicians to perceive an existential threat to their continued political and cultural power\u2014and, relatedly, to deny the legitimacy of their political opponents. As illustrated by the conduct of Republicans in Congress and statehouses, it is very unlikely that Republican politicians will respect constitutional norms when they deem so much to be at stake in each election and significant governmental decision. Moreover, Democratic politicians, when they regain full control of the political branches, may begin a campaign of retaliation that will include violations of norms. \n \nAs a result, one should expect continued violations of constitutional norms by American politicians to accomplish partisan goals\u2014what Mark Tushnet has called \u201cconstitutional hardball\u201d\u2014at least until the electoral impact of demographic changes in the electorate exceeds the electoral impact of the rural favoritism that is built into the nation\u2019s constitutional electoral processes. The Republican Party has likely been able to hold on to so much power without moderating for as long as it has primarily because of that rural favoritism. At the same time, the results of the 2020 elections indicate that the country is not nearly as liberal as the most liberal members of the Democratic Party may believe, so the party may remain under pressure to stay relatively moderate. Demography is not destiny, as the increase in Latino support for Trump in 2020 suggests, and the education-level divide may continue to play a significant role in party configurations in the years ahead. \n \nAt some point, however, the Republican Party may face a choice between losing most national elections and significantly broadening its appeal beyond racial, religious, cultural, and economic conservatives. Broadening the tent may again make it possible for the leaders of the Republican and Democratic Parties in the White House, Congress, and statehouses to sustain constitutional norms, but this time while sharing a commitment to racial equality. The sobering historical reality, discussed in this chapter, is that the leaders of the two parties have never been able to sustain norms and work together over a significant period of time when they have been divided over race. Put differently, the racial reckoning in the United States that continues to unfold as this chapter goes to press is likely responding in part to a history in which norm compliance and legislative cooperation among politicians in the two parties came largely at the expense of black people, who were not in \u201cthe room where it happened\u201d when fateful compromises were forged.", "authors": ["Neil S.

Prior to Trump\u2019s presidency, misinformation was a central issue in the 2016 U.S. election campaigns. The phenomenon goes well beyond politics, and according to the Pew Research Center\u2019s December 2016 survey, nearly a quarter of American adults admit to intentionally or unintentionally sharing \u201cfake news\u201d.2 Misinformation and mass audiences presents analyses by prominent researchers of communication, political science, public health, information science, psychology, and environmental studies. The diverse collection of interdisciplinary articles underscores the complexity of the subject and illustrates the extent to which misinformation pervades many aspects of our daily lives. The various chapters deal with cases of misinformation propounded by politicians, journalists, and corporations.

He makes no bones about it. President Trump has challenged decades old policies and commitments including NATO, One China, the EU, and NAFTA, among many others. President Trump makes clear his distaste for the media. President Trump inserted \"fake news\" into the American lexicon. President Trump is going to build that $25 billion wall along the United States and Mexican border. President Trump is going to start a trillion-dollar trade war with Mexico to compel Mexico to pay for the wall. Expect a big price increase for burritos, which use avocados imported from Mexico. President Donald Trump became a public figure because he kick started the media into making him a public figure. As a truly self-made public figure and snaring the greatest prize in recorded history, President Donald Trump knows no bounds, which is the reason for this article. This article argues that President Trump deigns to control his image and his message at nearly any cost. President Trump can succeed if he can tamp down the cacophony of shrieks and howls that shadow him. Threatening someone with a defamation suit succeeds in dialing down this rhetoric and throwing off the media and online stalkers. Additionally, this article demonstrates that opening the federal courts to defamations suits, and Shady Grove tossing anti-Slapp, topples New York Times v. Sullivan. Like all articles that suggest a change of the law, overturn a decision, or rewrite the law legislation or regulation, the article is 100% speculative but predictive. Certainly, once in a very blue moon (or red), an article topples existing law. However, this article is different. Instead, this article reveals the law of President Trump's intended consequences. President Trump wants to expand the right to sue for defamation. What President Trump really wants is to dam the rising reservoir of rejection, ill will and repudiation that might crest his presidency. For instance, Alec Baldwin is on President's Trump's sue list. A viable right to sue gets the job done because few erstwhile defendants have the resources to defend themselves. Defamation cases, even against a public figure, rise from the grave when the anti-Slapp statutes are kicked to the courthouse curb. Is the banishment of anti-Slapp viable? Under the vaulted ceiling of Shady Grove, the answer lies in the ideological animus of the Republican and Hard Right Congress whose own ambitions likewise know no bounds. America is about to take a new [Hard Right] turn. Just ask Alec Baldwin who said \"Yes, this is real life . . . this is really happening . . . on January 20th, I, Donald J.

The list includes erecting a wall on the border of Mexico, dissolving the Obama era sanctions imposed upon Russia, banning all Muslim immigrants by an Executive Order Redux, and tossing Obamacare. Although the list is endless and in progress, President Trump seeks the greater goal, which is to immunize him from any criticism, critique, rumor, innuendo or insult. President Trump pushes back from criticism, and verbally attacks all critics, including members of the new media (CNN \u2013 which he dubs a purveyor of \"fake news\"), Meryl Streep (\"overrated\"), and even the intelligence community for presenting rumors of illicit conduct (Nazi Germany). His weapon of mass humiliation is the 140-character Twitter feed that consumes all the media oxygen anywhere. What is #1 on President Trump's Wish List? Answer: \"One of the things I'm going to do if I win... I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,\" Trump said during a rally in Fort Worth, Texas. \"We're going to open up those libel laws so when The New York Times writes a hit piece, which is a total disgrace, or when the Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected,\" he said. \"We're going to open up libel laws and we're going to have people sue you like you've never got sued before.\" What is # 2 on President Trump's Wish List? Answer: \"Well in England they have a system where you can actually sue if someone says something wrong,\" Trump said. \"Our press is allowed to say whatever they want and get away with it. And I think we should go to a system where if they do something wrong \u2013 I'm a big believer, tremendous believer of the freedom of the press, nobody believes it stronger than me \u2013 but if they make terrible, terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people, and I'm not just talking about me, I'm talking about anybody else, then yes, I think you should have the ability to sue them.\" The Beacon of New York Times v.

No matter the deep shift to the Hard Right with one or more appointments to the Supreme Court in the next four to eight years, the Supreme Court is unlikely to overturn or shrink New York Times v. Sullivan. This body of law, on the books, will remain unchanged, no matter who sits in the White House or on the Supreme Court. This is the holding of New York Times v. Sullivan: \"[t]he constitutional guarantees require, we think, a federal rule that prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with \u2018actual malice\u2019\u2014 that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\" While this burden of proof is near Sisyphean, what stops the public official from the filing a lawsuit whose allegations contour to this holding? The answer is found under anti-Slapp statutes that enable the defendant to dismiss the action at the outset and without the burden or expense of endless litigation. For example, under California's robust anti-Slapp law, the defendant can move to strike the complaint if the complaint is based on constitutionally protected activity. If so, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the claim is viable, i.e., tenable. Given the broad sweep of New York Times v. Sullivan, the plaintiff would have to make out its prima facie case within nearly 30 days of the filing of the lawsuit. Thirty days is a very short period to demonstrate the probable validity of a defamation case. Anti-Slapp motions rid the court of suits that seek to chill, if not suppress, the exercise of constitutional rights for fear of expensive, harrowing and ruinous civil litigation. Chances are that the defendant wins, the complaint is dismissed, and the defendant collects significant attorney's fees, even if contingent upon the outcome of the case. Anti-Slapp litigation has no lack of takers given the mandatory fees awarded to the winning defendant. Anti-Slapp's are state statutes that find their way into federal courts. The current landscape of a libel suit follows down the path of the anti-Slapp statute that enables the defendant to end the litigation at the outset by forcing the plaintiff to put on a tenable case. Even if the defendant loses the anti-Slapp motion and faces the full frontal wrath of the angry plaintiff, the defendant enjoys the right of an immediate appeal. An anti-Slapp appeal stalls 5 N.Y.

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2018. 370p. $99.99 cloth, $29.99 paper.", "abstract": "During this age of purported voter apathy and citizen disengagement, Roderick P. Hart offers Civic Hope: How Ordinary Americans Keep Democracy Alive. In this book, Hart uses abundant evidence in the form of newspaper letters to the editor to demonstrate how a robust \u201cculture of argument\u201d (p. 10) sustains and nurtures democracy in the United States. Letters, Hart writes, evidence an ongoing willingness of people to call out imperfections in the nation\u2019s leaders and the nation\u2019s policies, while also debating ideas, in writing, with their neighbors. Hart draws his conclusions from a dataset that spans seven decades (1948\u20132018) and so runs the gamut from when newspapers were part of the daily artifice of many American doorsteps to the recent era of print decline and the rise of internet culture. Hart crafts his thesis around what he terms \u201ccivic hope,\u201d or the preternatural American ability to maintain faith in democratic ideals despite bleak odds. Such hope is more than optimism. It is a willingness of people to struggle with themselves and each other about the meaning of the nation in which they live and to push forward in the face of problems. By conducting a content analysis of 10,000 letters from newspapers in 12 midsize cities\u2014in addition to 10 surveys that happened over 20 years, as well as in-depth interviews with some letter writers and editors\u2014Hart provides insight into how people negotiate and clarify political values; expect their leaders and fellow citizens in the nation to act; and lament failures of behavior and action, publicly and permanently, in writing. By studying letters to the editor, Hart explains, scholars can apprehend the \u201ctexture of people\u2019s beliefs\u2014the reasons underlying their opinions and the varied ways in which a given belief can be expressed\u201d (p. 8; emphasis in original). Much of Hart\u2019s enthusiasm for studying letters derives from their source as grassroots evidence. The 12 cities from which he draws data are \u201cnothing special,\u201d he writes: they are not New York, San Francisco, or New Orleans (p. 22). Rather, they are places whose letters and writers are worthy of study precisely because they could be anywhere. Although those who write are almost never famous, they are important because they have composed at least one letter to the editor. This singular act elevates them beyond political cynicism. There is a kind of Tocquevillian nostalgia inherent in Hart\u2019s argument\u2014he admits as much himself (on p. 25)\u2014because he insists that citizenship is realized not only through voting but also through writing and speaking. This nostalgia extends to Hart\u2019s idealization of the printed word as the quintessential form of democratic debate. The book underexplores whether this idealization still holds in a twenty-first century, postTrump world. Hart also argues convincingly that letter writers act as citizen vanguards against disengagement and even disinformation. They keep the conversation going. However, recent studies make plain that the public is more likely than ever to believe in and act on falsehoods and lies. In later chapters, especially chapter 7, Hart suggests that even when letter writers get things wrong their contribution is still additive because they keep people thinking and conversing. However, as Yochai Benkler and Robert Faris recently wrote in Network Propaganda (2018), \u201cas a public we have lost our capacity to agree on shared modes of validation as to what is going on and what is just plain whacky\u201d (p. 6). Hart suggests that we can survive such wackiness so long as people keep writing. However, he never fully explains why this should be the case, except to celebrate how letters are the purview of ordinary people and reveal ordinary Americans\u2019 political ideas and anxieties. An indisputable strength of the book is Hart\u2019s use of breakout quotes from writers. The words give life to the manuscript, just as Hart argues that the letters he studies give vibrancy to US democracy. Readers move through time from commentary about Truman and Eisenhower to dyspeptic remarks about the character of Donald Trump. Such examples are grounded in extensive data analysis that includes digestible charts and bulleted lists that undergraduate readers may find helpful as they make their way through nearly 300 pages of text, not including appendices. Getting through so many pages is helped mightily by Hart\u2019s writing. His prose is engaging, authoritative, and scholarly all at the same time. Each chapter is well grounded in literature in political science and political communication. Hart nicely surveys what others have discovered about his questions and then uses his own letter data to color or trouble those conclusions. This tack works especially well in chapters 4\u20139, in which he wonders who writes letters, who reads them, what makes them compelling, and what makes them interesting, and more. Turning the stereotype of the crackpot curmudgeon on its head, Hart continually emphasizes the ordinary nature of those who compose letters, insisting that although they tend toward the earnest in personality, they make up for this with healthy doses of skepticism. Readers read letters for many reasons, including to learn and feel connected to the community.", "authors": ["Stephanie A.

President Trump has repeatedly cited his concerns over voter fraud associated with mail-in ballots as a reason that he may not abide by an adverse electoral outcome. Polling conducted in September 2020 suggests that nearly half of Republicans agree with the president that election fraud is a major concern associated with expanded mail-in voting during the pandemic. Few Democrats share that belief. Despite the consensus among independent academic and journalistic investigations that voter fraud is rare and extremely unlikely to determine a national election, tens of millions of Americans believe the opposite. This is a study of the disinformation campaign that led to widespread acceptance of this apparently false belief and to its partisan distribution pattern. Contrary to the focus of most contemporary work on disinformation, our findings suggest that this highly effective disinformation campaign, with potentially profound effects for both participation in and the legitimacy of the 2020 election, was an elite-driven, mass-media led process. Social media played only a secondary and supportive role.\r\n\r\nOur results are based on analyzing over fifty-five thousand online media stories, five million tweets, and seventy-five thousand posts on public Facebook pages garnering millions of engagements. They are consistent with our findings about the American political media ecosystem from 2015-2018, published in Network Propaganda , in which we found that Fox News and Donald Trump\u2019s own campaign were far more influential in spreading false beliefs than Russian trolls or Facebook clickbait artists. This dynamic appears to be even more pronounced in this election cycle, likely because Donald Trump\u2019s position as president and his leadership of the Republican Party allow him to operate directly through political and media elites, rather than relying on online media as he did when he sought to advance his then-still-insurgent positions in 2015 and the first half of 2016.\r\n\r\nOur findings here suggest that Donald Trump has perfected the art of harnessing mass media to disseminate and at times reinforce his disinformation campaign by using three core standard practices of professional journalism. These three are: elite institutional focus (if the President says it, it\u2019s news); headline seeking (if it bleeds, it leads); and balance , neutrality, or the avoidance of the appearance of taking a side. He uses the first two in combination to summon coverage at will, and has used them continuously to set the agenda surrounding mail-in voting through a combination of tweets, press conferences, and television interviews on Fox News. He relies on the latter professional practice to keep audiences that are not politically pre-committed and have relatively low political knowledge confused, because it limits the degree to which professional journalists in mass media organizations are willing or able to directly call the voter fraud frame disinformation. The president is, however, not acting alone. Throughout the first six months of the disinformation campaign, the Republican National Committee (RNC) and staff from the Trump campaign appear repeatedly and consistently on message at the same moments, suggesting an institutionalized rather than individual disinformation campaign. The efforts of the president and the Republican Party are supported by the right-wing media ecosystem, primarily Fox News and talk radio functioning in effect as a party press. These reinforce the message, provide the president a platform, and marginalize or attack those Republican leaders or any conservative media personalities who insist that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud associated with mail-in voting.\r\n\r\nThe primary cure for the elite-driven, mass media communicated information disorder we observe here is unlikely to be more fact checking on Facebook. Instead, it is likely to require more aggressive policing by traditional professional media, the Associated Press, the television networks, and local TV news editors of whether and how they cover Trump\u2019s propaganda efforts, and how they educate their audiences about the disinformation campaign the president and the Republican Party have waged.", "authors": ["Y.

His theoretical discussion is helpful, however, in discussing the limitations and some errors of Amy Zegart\u2019s 1999 Flawed by Design, which is among the most prominent discussions of intelligence in academic political science (pp. 42-43, 76, 79\u201380). For example, Durbin refutes Zegart\u2019s claim that the CIA was built primarily to serve parochial bureaucratic, not national, interests (p. 43); he finds instead that reformers constructed the CIA as a direct response to perceived national intelligence needs. Durbin\u2019s understanding of CIA history is generally good. He demonstrates considerable command of the scholarly literature on bureaucratic organizations and legislative reform of intelligence. But nearly absent are references to the three best journals on intelligence issues: the CIA\u2019s Studies in Intelligence, first published in 1955, and the more scholarly Intelligence and National Security and International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence, which date from the 1980s. These high-quality journals have markedly improved the literature on intelligence in recent years. Each has published much material relevant to Durbin\u2019s questions, as well as articles on many other aspects of intelligence. While his knowledge of the subject is good, Durbin makes a few questionable judgments and mistakes. For example, he attributes the demise in 1973 of the CIA\u2019s Office of National Estimates, which drafted national intelligence estimates (NIEs), to the fraying Cold War consensus of the time (p. 130); most students of CIA history believe instead that it reflected mounting unhappiness with the judgmental errors contained in NIEs in the 1960s and early 1970s, which were due largely to the declining abilities of estimators over the years as the CIA\u2019s leaders assigned lesser analysts to the Office. He attributes the writing of NIE 11-3/8-75 on Soviet strategic programs, which triggered the infamous Team A/Team B \u201ccompetitive analysis\u201d of Soviet strategic military capabilities and intentions of 1976, to the CIA (p. 130). In fact, by this time NIEs were coordinated assessments of the intelligence community as a whole. And he incorrectly reports current House intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes\u2019s name to beDavidNunes (p. 251). But given the complexity of the issues he discusses and the many subtle changes that occurred in intelligence institutions over time, Durbin\u2019s command of CIA history is impressive. The book\u2019s last chapter outlines an important and realistic research agenda. Persuasively warning that \u201c[s] tudents and practitioners of international relations ignore intelligence at their peril\u201d (p. 267), Durbin argues that intelligence is a variable in international relations, not a constant, and that its importance can be demonstrated in case studies. (The specialist intelligence literature has done some such work.) He notes that the study of intelligence reform is a useful adjunct to the study of bureaucratic processes in general (pp. 270\u201371), and he accurately observes that his book lightly treats the goals and interests of intelligence services themselves (p. 267). To Durbin\u2019s research agenda might be added a consideration of why intelligence reform proposals so often reflect retread, failed ideas that have little or no chance of improving intelligence performance, and why reformers seem unable to craft reform proposals that generate institutional incentives that make intelligence professionals want to implement them. And the stunning, unprecedented public display since 2016 of partisanship by current and former intelligence officers, most prominently demonstrated by former director of the CIA John Brennan\u2019s verbal attacks on President Donald Trump, suggests new questions about the partisanship of the intelligence bureaucracy, the possibility of new varieties of politicization within U.S. intelligence agencies, and the evolving nature of the CIA\u2019s organizational interests. For intelligence practitioners, Durbin offers one of the best academic treatments of intelligence agencies\u2019 dealings with reformers in intelligence oversight roles.

Results: A total of 922 requests posted by 28 different centers for routine Advagraf adjustment in 530 different patients treated with Advagraf were studied. The exposure to, and dose requirement of, tacrolimus significantly increased across the first posttransplant months before reaching steady state. The AUC:C0 ratio (on which C0 monitoring is implicitly based) was stable across the different posttransplant periods, although with high interindividual variability. C0\u2013AUC correlation was stronger in the late than in the early posttransplant period (r2 = 0.75 versus 0.63; P = 0.0075). Using the regression equations obtained, AUC ranges corresponding to different applicable C0 target ranges were calculated to guide dose adjustment. When one of the doses recommended was administered, the following AUC was significantly more often in the predicted target ranges (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: This study improves our knowledge of Advagraf pharmacokinetic variability and relations between exposure indices and the scientific background of the expert service provided through the ISBA Web site.", "authors": ["P.

An adalimumab (tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitor) biosimilar, GP2017 (SDZ-ADL; Sandoz), has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (July 2018) for use in all same indications as adalimumab, including AS. Adalimumab has also shown low long-term radiographic progression in patients with AS. Direct comparison of radiographic progression in AS between IL-17A and TNF inhibitors has not been studied. SURPASS is the first head-to-head, Phase IIIb, randomized, biologic-controlled study in AS to compare effects of secukinumab versus SDZ-ADL on spinal radiographic progression. Methods Overall, 858 biologic-na\u00efve patients with AS with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (\u2265\u20095\u00a0mg/L) and/or at least one syndesmophyte in the cervical/lumbar spine at baseline (without total ankylosis) were randomized (1:1:1) to subcutaneous (sc) secukinumab (300 or 150\u00a0mg) or SDZ-ADL (40\u00a0mg). Secukinumab will be administered at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then every 4\u00a0weeks until week 100. SDZ-ADL will be administered every 2\u00a0weeks from baseline until week 102.

In 5-10% of AML cases, specific KMT2A gene perturbations can occur which result in an aggressive and poor prognostic group of blood cancers. The KMT2A complex also appears to play a central role in the epigenetic dysregulation in AMLs with co-mutations such as NPM1, IDH1/2, EZH2, and DNMT3A. Therefore, there is strong rationale for targeting these AML subsets which may be exquisitely sensitive to inhibition of the menin-KMT2A chromatin complex.\n KO-539 is a novel, once daily, oral investigational drug candidate targeting the menin-KMT2A protein-protein interaction.\n KOMET-001 (NCT04067336) is an ongoing Phase 1/2A open-label study evaluating KO-539 in adult patients (pts) with relapsed and/or refractory AML agnostic to oncogenic mutational type. The Phase 1 dose-escalation objectives are to assess safety and tolerability, characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK), and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose. The Phase 2A dose expansion portion will assess anti-leukemic activity, PK, safety and tolerability in select genetic subtypes of AML. Preclinically, the drug is shown to be highly protein bound (>99%) across animal species. Using physiologically-based PK (PBPK) modeling, the estimated human efficacious dose was estimated to be 600 mg po qd.\n As of data cutoff on August 10, 2020, 6 pts with relapsed and/or refractory AML have been enrolled in the trial. Dose escalation began with single pt cohorts at 50 mg po qd in 28 day cycles and has proceeded through to 200 mg dosing cohorts. An expansion of 3 pts at 200 mg was initiated to better characterize the PK and exposure of KO-539.\n To date, 3 enrolled pts have been studied for safety and have not experienced any dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within the 28 day DLT-assessment window. Grade 3 (G3) or higher drug related adverse events have included G3 tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) at 50 mg and a G3 embolic event at 100 mg. KO-539 has been well tolerated with no dose interruptions or discontinuations due to drug related adverse events. There were no treatment-related deaths, and two pts discontinued treatment due to disease progression. Peak drug concentrations were attained between 2-3 hours after daily oral dosing with an elimination half-life of greater than 24 hours.\n KO-539 has demonstrated evidence of biologic activity in pts in the first 3 dose levels treated to date. The 50 mg pt with a KMT2A-r and the 200 mg pt with a p53 mutation and PICALM-AF10 fusion exhibited evidence of tumor lysis syndrome and markedly decreased hydroxyurea requirements with blood count stabilization, respectively. A third pt (100 mg dose level) with SETD2 and RUNX1 co-mutations achieved a complete remission with confirmed negative MRD by flow cytometry after two cycles of therapy and continues on treatment. The biologic activity of KO-539 at lower doses may be explained by inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme by concomitantly administered azole antifungals. KO-539 is metabolized into at least two metabolites with comparable activity to KO-539; total drug concentrations (i.e., KO-539 plus active metabolites) exhibited a dose-dependent increase.\n Although KO-539 is a CYP3A4 substrate, preclinical data suggest both KO-539 and its metabolites act as inhibitors, potentially providing an advantage in overcoming drug resistance attributable to CYP3A4 metabolism by bone marrow stroma. The physiology of the bone marrow sinusoids also allows both unbound and protein-bound drug to reach the sites of leukemic involvement. The high level of protein binding may therefore provide an opportunity for organ-specific targeted action while possibly limiting off target effects. The potential advantage associated with the CYP3A4 inhibitory characteristics of KO-539 to overcome drug-resistance in the bone marrow stroma also continues to be investigated.\n In conclusion, the early biologic activity of KO-539 in relapsed AML is encouraging, and its unique PK characteristics may be advantageous for clinical benefit. In addition to the above, any updated safety, PK, and efficacy data will be presented at the time of the conference.\n \n \n Wang: Abbvie: Consultancy; Jazz Pharmaceuticals: Consultancy; Bristol Meyers Squibb (Celgene): Consultancy; Genentech: Consultancy; Pfizer: Speakers Bureau; Stemline: Speakers Bureau; PTC Therapeutics: Consultancy; Macrogenics: Consultancy; Astellas: Consultancy.

This additional disease burden has not been well quantified in the ASLS population. PURPOSE To assess nonthoracolumbar orthopedic (NTO) disease burden in ASLS patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter study. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Retrospective review of prospective multicenter cohort. PATIENT SAMPLE Patients enrolled in the ASLS prospective multicenter study of operative vs nonoperative treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES Occurrence of non-thoracolumbar orthopedic events, Scoliosis Research Society-22r (SRS-22), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), SF-12 physical component summary (PCS). METHODS The ASLS study is a prospective multicenter study to assess operative vs nonoperative treatment for ASLS, with randomized and observational arms. Patients recruited were 40-80 years old with ASLS, defined as a lumbar coronal Cobb >30\u00b0 and ODI >20 or SRS-22 RESULTS Two hundred eighty-six patients (mean age 60 yrs, 90% women) were enrolled, with as-treated cohorts of 173 operative and 113 nonoperative patients, and 4-yr follow-up rate of 81%. At a mean follow-up of 3.8 yrs (SD=0.9 yrs), 108 NTO events were reported, affecting 71 (24.8%) patients. The most common NTO events included: arthroplasty (n=39), fractures (n=26), joint ligament/cartilage repair (n=13), cervical surgery (n=7), and carpal tunnel release (n=5). Patients with an NTO event were significantly older (63 vs 59 yrs, p CONCLUSIONS ASLS patient have a high NTO disease burden, with almost 25% of patients in this prospective multicenter study having an orthopedic condition requiring surgical treatment or a fracture within 3.8 yrs following study enrollment. Patients with an NTO event were more likely to have any history of smoking and had worse baseline spinal deformity and disability. These conditions may further impact HRQL and recovery following ASLS treatment.

The need for dose adjustment following bariatric surgery was examined, as well as the potential for extrapolation to other drugs subjected to coinciding pharmacokinetic mechanisms. A total of 22 original articles and 32 different drugs were assessed. The majority of available data is based on Roux\u2010en\u2010Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) (18 of 22 studies), and hence, the overall interpretation is more or less limited to RYGBP. In the case of the majority of studied drugs, an increased absorption rate was observed early after RYGBP. The effect on systemic exposure allows for a low degree of extrapolation, including between drugs subjected to the same major metabolic and transporter pathways. On the basis of current understanding, predicting the pharmacokinetic change for a specific drug following RYGBP is challenging. Close monitoring of each individual drug is therefore recommended in the early postsurgical phase.

Besides, literature reports that specific types of mouthguards may become an ergogenic device that facilitates a powerful jaw clenching, and a subsequent concurrent activation potentiation through this remote voluntary contraction of the mandible muscles. Methods A randomized within-subjects design was used to study the effects of this mechanism on muscular performance (vertical jump, agility, bench press power and leg press power) into two different conditions (mouthguard and no mouthguard) in high-standard basketball players (n = 13).

Foot orthoses are commonly used to support the deformed foot arch, and improve normal foot function. However, it is unclear if foot orthoses use affects jump performance in athletes. Our study aims to investigate if foot type and/or foot orthosis influence countermovement jump (CMJ) and standing broad jump (SBJ) performance and lower limb biomechanics.MethodsTwenty-six male basketball players were classified into normal-arched (n\u2009=\u200915) or flat-footed (n\u2009=\u200911) groups using the Chippaux-Smirak index, navicular drop test, and the resting calcaneal angle measurement. They performed jumps with and without prefabricated foot orthoses. We measured jump height and distance for CMJ and SBJ, respectively. Hip, knee and ankle joint angles, angular velocities, moments and powers during take-off were also measured.ResultsFor CMJ, the flat-footed group exhibited less ankle plantarflexion (F1,24\u2009=\u20098.407, p\u2009=\u20090.008, \u03b7p2\u2009=\u20090.259 large effect) and less hip joint power (F1,24\u2009=\u20097.416, p\u2009=\u20090.012, \u03b7p2\u2009=\u20090.244 large effect) than the normal-arched group.

Compared to the normal-arched individuals, flat-footed athletes generated smaller propulsion GRF and lower hip flexion velocity and power, which suggests possible compensatory movement strategies to maximise jump performance. Future studies may investigate whether these altered biomechanics, taking into consideration their respective magnitude and effect sizes, may have implications on lower limb injuries.

Few research studies exist into wireless RF signal tracking of players in indoor team sports, in particular the game of basketball. Utilising the RF signal trilateration positioning technique with three anchor nodes per quarter court, players wearing RF beacons could be tracked and their positional data recorded in real time. This study builds on a previous study conducted under static conditions by Kirkup et al. (2013). Identifying the player with the ball is also important in recording and assessing team strategies. Accelerometer sensors located on the body have been widely used to monitor the movements of the body and can potentially be used to recognize when a player is bouncing the basketball (dribbling). This paper reports the findings of using the received signal strength positioning technique with one anchor node to estimate the position of a moving basketball player towards the node and the use of a wearable triaxial accelerometer sensor to identify the person bouncing the ball. Both slow and fast game pace conditions are tested. Player position accuracy can be achieved to within 0.5m for distances less than 9m. A study of the power law variation in signal strength over distance gives an exponent n of 2.23 under moderate paced conditions with a Pearson squared correlation coefficients of r2 = 0.42. This means that 42% of the variation can be explained by the approximation. Under moving conditions, changes in the transmit antenna orientation will result in an increase of random variation in position prediction which is included in this result. The acceleration signature from a wrist sensor of the hand-ball contact process while dribbling distinctively shows ball dribbling possession. A single moving player scenario is discussed and measured results with and without the basketball demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of the positioning and ball possession techniques.

Those observed in-situ on the active 2012 lava dome of Volcan de Colima range from voids with intra-clasts showing little movement and interpreted to be failure-nuclei, to sub-parallel lenses of sintered granular aggregate interpreted as fragmentation horizons, through to infilled fractures with evidence of viscous remobilization. All tuffisites show evidence of sintering. Further examination of the complex fracture-and-channel patterns reveals viscous backfill by surrounding magma, suggesting that lava fragmentation was followed by stress relaxation and continued viscous deformation as the tuffisites formed. The natural tuffisites are more permeable than the host andesite, and have a wide range of porosity and permeability compared to a narrower window for the host rock, and gauging from their significant distribution across the dome, we posit that the tuffisite veins may act as important outgassing pathways. To investigate tuffisite formation we crushed and sieved andesite from the lava dome and sintered it at magmatic temperatures for different times. We then assessed the healing and sealing ability by measuring porosity and permeability, showing that sintering reduces both over time. During sintering the porosity-permeability reduction occurs due to the formation of viscous necks between adjacent grains, a process described by the neck-formation model of Frenkel (1945). This process leads the granular starting material to a porosity-permeability regime anticipated for effusive lavas, and which describes the natural host lava as well as the most impervious of natural tuffisites. This suggests that tuffisite formation at Volcan de Colima constructed a permeable network that enabled gas to bleed passively from the magma. We postulate that this progressively reduced the lava dome\u2019s ability to seal and build pressure that drives explosions. Indeed, the time interval between explosions during 2007 to 2011 gradually increased before the onset of a period of quiescence starting in June 2011.

The influence of meteorology and climate change on plant phenology include shifts in the timing of the pollination seasons or an increase of the pollen production of different plants. \nThe present study explores the role of meteorological variability in the pollen dynamics. The main standardized pollen parameters (Annual Pollen Integral (APIn), Start, End and Length of the main pollen season) of 22 taxa collected by the Xarxa Aerobiologica de Catalunya (XAC) at 6 stations in Catalonia (Barcelona (BCN), Bellaterra (BTU), Girona (GIC), Lleida (LLE), Manresa (MAN) and Tarragona (TAU)) during the 18-year period from 1994 to 2011, have been considered. \nCorrelations between precipitation, insolation and temperature and the main pollen parameters have been investigated. The results obtained report the synchronism registered in the variations of pollen concentration with precipitation (negative), insolation (positive) and temperature (positive). Temperature was the meteorological variable that showed a greater influence in the pollen production and the timing of the pollen season, being insolation the least one. The Start of the main pollen season was the pollen parameter more correlated with the meteorological variables, especially with winter temperatures. \nThe influence of the climate variability associated with Northern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns (North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation and Western Mediterranean Oscillation) over the main pollen parameters has been also investigated. For most of the taxa, positive phases of the 3 climatic indices were related to a decrease in the APIn and an advance and enlargement of the main pollen season. Furthermore, negative phases of the climatic indices were linked to higher pollen production via an increase in rainfall. \nIn order to study the effect of local winds, 12 pollen types with sources are situated near the stations were considered. It was found that a positive correlation, thus an increase of pollen concentration, exists when the wind blows towards the station from the direction of the source location, and negative correlation, meaning dispersion and cleaning processes, results when the wind blows in a direction from the station towards the source of pollen or coming from the sea. This study could also be useful not only to identify and locate airborne pollen sources but to detect changes in land uses near the sampling stations.The cleaning and dispersion effect over the pollen concentrations has been observed over the coastal stations (BCN, BTU and TAU) mainly due to the wind induced by the sea breeze effect, and over the inland stations (LLE and MAN) when westerly frontal synoptic situations are produced. \nTwo forecasting models were used to predict the Start of the main pollen season. The first method consists on the cumulative sum of the daily average temperature. The second method consists on a multiple regression using rainfall and temperatures. These two models were tested by computing the discrepancy between the predicted and the observed values by means of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE ranged from 0.7 days for Pistacia in Manresa, up to 10 days for other taxa and stations.

Not only; the entire solar system is changing too. The obeserved reconnection among the three terrestrial, solar and interplanetary magnetic fields actually indicates their imminent, rapid and contemporary reversal. This is an unprecedented event in human history, since the last reversal of the Earth's magnetic field occurred 41,000 years ago. Is a magnetic reversal a danger? No, it is the wondrous opportunity to realize what Life is and, as a consequence, what human consciousness is, to finally discover and use our inner abilities for participating in the new era. The solar wind is very fast plasma that escapes from the Sun\u2019s surface and spreads throughout the solar system with a spiral that touches the Earth\u2019s soil at 3:30 in the night, when the hormonal secretion of all us, humans, occurs. This daily meeting involves humans\u2019 physiology and the three terrestrial, solar and interplanetary magnetic fields into which we are all imbedded, in particular the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) carried by the solar wind (Fig. 1). These three reverse their North-South respective polarities with various rhythms. \u2022 The IMF has the fastest reversals (few minutes). \u2022 The solar magnetic field usually reverses its polarity every 11 years. \u2022 The Earth\u2019s one, or geomagnetic field, has very irregular reversals. The latest one occurred 41.000 and lasted about 450 years. The geomagnetic field is fading at accelerate rates and reconnecting with the other two solar and interplanetary magnetic fields. \u201cThe Force awakens\u201d according to the Star Wars Saga. It is not only science fiction for the humans who either awaken at 3:30 in the night or anyway feel that there is something new in the \u201cair\u201d. This \u201cair\u201d can be the secret relation between all Fig. 1. the Earth\u2019s magnetosphereThe solar wind penetrat es the spins, that compose our human body, and the three magnetic fields, which are re-connecting and re-composing their own rhythms.

Laniakea is a Hawaiian word that means \u201cimmense heaven\u201d; it instantly joins the speeds of the galactic nuclei, which are billion light-years distant, showing their coherent dance. Follow-up studies have clearly proved that Laniakea is not gravitationally bound.

Other clues regard the Earth (Fig. 8) and many other phenomena such as: (1) the solar wind that escapes from the presumed \u201cstrong\u201d gravity of the Sun. (2) The Earth\u2019s Crystalline Core that rotates independently from the rest of the Earth (Fig. 8). (3) The accelerating expansion of the Universe, awarded with the Nobel Prize, in 2011. (4) The tested and re-tested independence of the Standard Model of physics from gravity. This is the set of 24 particles and 24 antiparticles that can compose all the existing bodies of the Universe, the human ones included, and can easily communicate with the almost \u201cunknown\u201d electroweak Force (Fig. 6). (5) Why do 100,000 galaxies, billions of light-year distant from each other, dance together and humans fight against each other? (6) Because we are afflicted by a huge blindness that regards our human sight and the scientific one too (Fig. 3). This regards 95% of the universal mass dark matter (25%) and dark energy (70%) \u2013 according to the orthodox scientific theories. Most scientists now agree that dark energy pullulates from \u201cvacuum\u201d that is not emptiness, as we formerly believed. \u201cVacuum\u201d actually fluctuates, buzzes with particle-antiparticle couples that are popping in and out of the \u201cexistence\u201d that allows our human observations. Up to a few decades ago, these couples were only evident in the high-energy accelerators. Since 1994 another news: space probes have observed Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGF\u2019s) in our atmosphere and, in 2009, the Fermi Gamma Ray Telescope in Earth Orbit, observed intense gamma rays burst that produced about 100 trillion positrons, i.e. antielectrons. Such a huge quantity of anti particles had never been previously observed; it is another clue that \u201csomething new is in the air\u201d: it is antimatter in our atmosphere in this case. (7) Poorly understood TGF\u2019s \u2013 also indicated as \u201cDark Lightnings\u201d may often precede Lightning Strikes. Researchers have actually identified a \u201cdark lightning\u201d preceding a visible lightning of a few milliseconds. This finding provided observational evidence that the two phenomena, dark and luminous lightnings, are connected; it could open the \u201cdoors\u201d to a nearby future that coexists with our present (Fig. 4). Which kind of \u201cdoors\u201d? Probably spacetime singularities, the large ones, hidden into the nuclei of the giant galaxies and, also, the very minute ones, hidden into the atomic nuclei that compose all the observable bodies.

Theories calculate their existence ans so show the possible existence of many universes, which are in the future respect to our present. These show the mathematical possibility to jump in the future, to transit from our present \u201creality\u201d to a new one. It is not just science fiction. Spinning black and white holes are like the two extremes of one same coaxial \u201ccable\u201d: the black ones absorb matter and emit information, while the white ones do vice versa, emit matter and absorb information. Astronomers have recognized many black holes in the sky linked to the Cosmic Web (Fig. 3), but not yet white ones. What if our endocrine glads where white holes? (Fig. 5) We could be the intelligent terminal of the Cosmic Web which instantly transmit motions, for us emotions or hormones that affect our humors and emerge from our minute endocrine glands, exactly when the solar wind touches the Earth's surface. Hormones are the clues of the daily bread that can affect our humors and the physiology of our body, ultimately composed of particles that rotate, i.e. have spins and/or angular momenta in technical terms. Rotation is the key motion that links every single body to all the magnetic fields. Furthermore our hormonal secretion is linked to the Earth\u2019s rotation and also to the Sun\u2019s one (Fig. 5). At present the Earth\u2019s rotation is slowing down. Most scientists believe that this observed fact is imperceptible for us humans. Yet there are many people who feel it, simply because whatever Fig. 4 \u2013 The Penrose diagram shows the rotation is linked to magnetic fields which, on their turn, affect all the spins, coexistence of many universes and the hence the motions of all the fluids, within and without our bodies. These Rosen-Einstein bridges, that allow the motions involve our three fluids: the red blood and the lymph or white transit from one to another universe. blood, the cerebro spinal fluid that moves inside our vertebral column and our brain. This last fluid is often blocked by our cerebellum, responsible for primary functions such as temporality and sexuality. Common human behaviours actually oscillate between the \u201chigher\u201d, rational abilities of our grey matter and the \u201clow\u201d instinct of the cerebellum, also indicated as the \u201creptilian brain\u201d. What is time? Time is the effect of any cyclic motion. The Earth has many cyclic motions. For instance the diurnal rotation generates the duration of our day which is lengthening, while the Earth\u2019s annual rotation generates the duration of our year. Since there are many cycles in every body, there many times that we are now able to recongnize and so realize that their rhythms are all changing. These range from the fastest ones, now evident in TGF\u2019s and also in biological processes such as the folding of proteins into human bodies. The wonder is that all the natural rhythms have been composed in one, Eternal Harmony that artists and musicians, sages and poets have always felt and expressed in Fig. 5 The solar wind is very fast, very wide and weak. The three fluids, that circulate into our bodies, have different relations with all the three magnetic fields into which our bodies are imbedded. various ways. Who or what is Its Author?

Desert mistletoe, Phoradendron californicum (Viscaceae), is a dioecious parasitic plant that grows on woody legumes in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts, produces minute flowers during winter, and is dispersed by birds defecating fruits. Pollination of desert mistletoe has not been examined despite the species' reliance on insects for transporting pollen from male to female plants. I investigated the pollination of P. californicum parasitizing Acacia greggii (Fabaceae) shrubs at 3 sites at different elevations in the Mojave Desert of southern Nevada during February 2015. I examined pollen from male flowers, aspirated insects landing on female flowers, and counted pollen grains in insect pollen loads. Desert mistletoe's tricolpate pollen differed from a previous description by being oblate instead of subprolate in equatorial view. Female flowers were visited by 13 species of Diptera in 10 genera and 6 families and 3 species of Hymenoptera in 3 families. Almost all (98.5%) of the pollen carried by insects was from desert mistletoe. Five species of phytophagous fruit flies in Tephritidae were frequently found on flowers, comprising 53% of the insects collected, but carried low amounts of P. californicum pollen. Two species of blow flies in Calliphoridae, both larval decomposers of animals, were also relatively abundant on flowers and carried moderate to high pollen loads. Flies in Syrphidae, 2 predators and 1 plant-decomposer, carried varying amounts of conspecific pollen. Conspecific pollen loads also varied on a species of native bee in Halictidae and on naturalized honey bees in Apidae. Desert mistletoe appears to be pollinated mostly by tephritids, due to their abundance on female flowers, and by calliphorids. Blow flies would be more likely than fruit flies to carry pollen between male and female plants on different host shrubs due to their larger size and stronger flight. Parasitic, dioecious P. californicum plants appear to rely on a web of mutualism between fruit-eating birds and flower-fertilizing insects.", "authors": ["W.

We have developed a quantitative model for the interaction of a dusty ionized flow with nearby (massive) stars where radiation pressure stalls dust, piling it up at an appreciable distance (>0.1 pc), and force it to flow around the star. The model demonstrates that for the conditions in IC 434, the gas will decouple from the dust and will keep its original flow lines. Hence, we argue that this dust structure is the first example of a dust wave created by a massive star moving through the interstellar medium.

The results show that for late O-type stars with weak stellar winds, the stand-o distance of the resulting bow shock is very close to the star, well within the location of the dust wave. In general, we conclude that dust waves and bow waves should be common around stars showing the weak-wind phenomenon, i.e., stars with log(L=L ) < 5.2, and that these structures are best observed at mid-IR to FIR wavelengths, depending on the stellar spectral type.

The few epidemiological analyses of meteorological factors, aeroallergens, and allergic diseases demonstrate the pathways through which climate can exert its influence on aeroallergens and allergic diseases.

These loess records, which are disconnected from the North European Loess Belt (NELB), are of significant interest to document the evolution of perimediterranean landscapes and environments during the Last Glacial. To overcome the poor precision of available aeolian distribution maps, aeolian deposits were mapped using the topsoil textural database provided by the Land Use and Cover Area frame Statistical Survey project (LUCAS). The grain-size distribution of aeolian sand and loess was first determined using 116 samples taken from surveyed outcrops. Then, the areas showing a similar grain-size composition were extracted from the LUCAS rasters. The resulting map reproduces the conventional maps correctly but suggests a more significant extension of loess, in better agreement with the known distribution of outcrops. The map shows that the distinctive morphology of the valley dominantly controls the distribution of aeolian deposits. The deflation-related landforms, i.e., yardangs, closed depressions (pans), and desert pavements, are widespread south of narrowings of the Rhone Valley between latitudes 44\u00b0N and 45\u00b0N. They indicate palaeowinds blowing from the north/northwest. Aeolian sand, loessic sand, sandy loess, and loess deposits successively spread on both sides of the Rhone River. The loess is characterized by a coarse texture (main mode around 60\u202f\u03bcm), strong local thickness (>5\u202fm), limited extension, and abundant bioturbation.

These analyses did not include data from North America as flash glucose monitoring became available in late 2017. The objective of this follow-up analysis is to focus on real world outcomes in patients using flash glucose monitoring in Canada. A server collected anonymized data from patients whose flash glucose readers are uploaded (by patient or health care professional). Data from patients within Canada was analyzed through September 2018 (approximately 1 year). To understand the relationship between time in range and glucose variability with monitoring frequency, individuals were divided into 10 equal sized groups based on scanning frequency. Average \u00b1 SE time in range (glucose 70 mg/dL - 180 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L - 10.0 mmol/L]) and time in glucose \u2264 54 mg/dL (\u223c3.0 mmol/L) was calculated for each group. This analysis includes 15,424 readers, 95,103 sensors, and 108 million glucose measurements with an average of 12 scans per day.

Real-world data from Canada demonstrates that higher frequency of scanning is associated with increased time in range and decreased hypoglycemia.

The inventory of Pierre Maheust's possessions in 1717 is also of considerable historical interest. Possibly, Abb\u2022 Maheux has too readily assumed that his readers will all possess his own broad and accurate knowledge of the historical background in which his family survey is set.

There are plausible links between exposure to specific air pollutants and dementia. Objective: To systematically review the evidence base with respect to the relationship between air pollution and later cognitive decline and dementia. Methods: Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO\u00ae were searched from their inception to September 2018, for publications reporting on longitudinal studies of exposure to air pollution and incident dementia or cognitive decline in adults. Studies reporting on exposure to tobacco smoke including passive smoking or on occupational exposure to pollutants were excluded. Using standard Cochrane methodology, two readers identified relevant abstracts, read full text publications, and extracted data into structured tables from relevant papers, as defined by inclusion and exclusion criteria. Papers were also assessed for validity. CRD42018094299 Results: From 3,720 records, 13 papers were found to be relevant, with studies from the USA, Canada, Taiwan, Sweden, and the UK. Study follow-up ranged from one to 15 years. Pollutants examined included particulate matter \u22642.5 \u03bc (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrous oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone. Studies varied in their methodology, population selection, assessment of exposure to pollution, and method of cognitive testing. Greater exposure to PM2.5, NO2/NOx, and CO were all associated with increased risk of dementia. The evidence for air pollutant exposure and cognitive decline was more equivocal.

The workshop back then aimed at putting the initial seeds for a new research community that collects experts in CAD with a special focus on machine learning (ML) from both industrial as well as academic fields. The workshop later turned into a regular workshop sponsored by IEEE and ACM called MLCAD: http://mlcad.itec.kit.edu, and the first edition was held in September 2019 in Canada. Advances in ML over the past half-dozen years promise to revolutionize the effectiveness of ML in a large variety of domains. However, design processes present challenges that require parallel advances in ML and CAD as compared to traditional ML applications such as image classification. CAD in this context is broadly defined as design-time techniques as well as run-time techniques. In this context, this special issue on ML for CAD focuses on introducing, exploring, and investigating the current as well as future challenges and opportunities when ML and CAD come together. One of the key goals of this special issue is to offer the readers, who are not specialists in ML or may not even have a specific background, a new perspective of the varied ongoing efforts in research that aim at employing ML techniques and algorithms, evolved over decades, in supporting CAD tools. Another goal is to demonstrate to readers how bringing ML and CAD together can open new doors in research toward increasing the efficiency of computing through advanced ML. This holds for both chip design as well as run-time management techniques. In particular, the special issue covers various abstraction layers. It demonstrates how ML does enrich both design-time as well as run-time CAD methodologies to significantly improve their effectiveness. In this special issue, we have 12 interesting articles coving a wide range of different CAD areas. Starting from intelligent methods for chip testing and faults diagnosis, the articles \u201cToward Smarter Diagnosis: A Learning-Based Diagnostic Outcome Previewer\u201d by Q.

Liu, and \u201cMachine Learning-Based Defect Coverage Boosting of Analog Circuits under Measurement Variations\u201d by N. Xama et al. demonstrate how ML techniques can very effectively increase the yield of chips and help chips\u2019 designers to rapidly identify existing defects in both digital as well as analog circuits. When it comes to FPGA chips, a new method to improve the routability using ML was proposed in \u201cImproving FPGA-Based Logic Emulation Systems through Machine Learning\u201d by H. Szentimrey et al. In addition, A. Agnesina et al. demonstrated the role that ML may play in emulations in their article \u201cImproving FPGA-Based Logic Emulation Systems through Machine Learning.\u201d One of the major challenges that faces designers in the nano-CMOS era is improving the reliability and security of on-chip systems in which the effects of circuit\u2019s aging as well as the threats of adversarial attacks are kept at bay.

Canada Among Nations 2015: Elusive Pursuits: Lessons from Canada\u2019s Interventions Abroad Centre for International Governance Innovation", "abstract": "Reviewed by: Aaron Ettinger, University of WaterlooIt is uncommon for an academic book review to begin with the cover art but the 29th volume of Canada Among Nations is worthy of mention. Gracing the front is the image of a special operations soldier with parachute in full bloom, slightly above a treeline, with a snow-capped mountain in the distance. Exactly what the paratrooper will encounter on the ground is not clear. It is a clever visual representation of the challenge of intervention and the purpose of this volume. Elusive Pursuits serves as a comparative evaluation of Canadian interventions in the post-Cold War era, a period that saw Canada in (or above) Afghanistan, Bosnia, East Timor, Haiti, Kosovo, Libya, Somalia, and at present, Iraq-Syria. Elusive Pursuits is intended to provide lessons learned for that paratrooper and the policymakers that will send him drifting to the ground the next time, wherever and whenever that may be.The volume is inspired by the formal end of the Afghanistan mission in 2014, which looms large in the Canadian consciousness. Or, to be more precise, what looms large is the deadly 2006-2011 period of counter-insurgency in Kandahar. This informs the scope of \"intervention\" laid out in the editors' introduction, which defines it narrowly as \"the use of force to affect the domestic dynamics of another country, with the broad aim of contributing to international peace and security\" (3). It is for the best, however, that the contributors do not strictly adhere to this definition. After all, Canada's experience with \"intervention\" is much broader than the introduction lets on. Thus, Elusive Pursuit's principal strength is the broad perspective it takes on intervention and the insights that flow from diverse scholarship on the issue. The individual contributions in this volume cover a wide expanse of issues that serve to remind readers of the scope and implications of Canada's interventions over the past 25 years. There are chapters on Canada's recent high-profile combat experiences in Iraq/Syria, Kandahar, and Libya, but also on diplomatic responses to the Arab Spring, security sector reform initiatives in Haiti, and the disastrous peacekeeping and aid mission in Somalia, the consequences of which still linger. Furthermore, there are up-to-date analyses of how Canadian government institutions and society have evolved during the post-September 11 era.Undoubtedly, though, the most ambitious and controversial chapter in Elusive Pursuits tries to articulate the Harper Doctrine on military intervention by schematizing the operational code that informed Stephen Harper's \"duty-driven internationalism.\" Authors Derek Burney, Fen Osler Hampson, and Simon Palamar make the important observation that Harper's interventions appeared to mimic the humanitarian and multilateral impulses of liberal internationalism, but his pathways to military intervention are entirely different. \u2026", "authors": ["Aaron Ettinger"], "citations": 0, "venue": "", "year": 2017}}}
